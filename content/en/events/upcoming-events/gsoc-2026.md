- Be at least 18 years old at time of registration.
- Be a student or an [open source beginner](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#how_do_i_know_if_i_am_considered_a_beginner_in_open_source_development).
- Be eligible to work in their country of residence during duration of program.
- Be a resident of a country not currently embargoed by the United States.

### Steps

1. Sign up as a student on the [GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
2. Join the [Kubeflow Slack](/docs/about/community/#kubeflow-slack-channels):
   - **NOTE:** please **do not** reach out privately to mentors, instead, start a thread in the [`#kubeflow-contributors`](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C0742LBR5BM) channel so others can see the response.
3. Learn about Kubeflow:
   - Read the [Introduction to Kubeflow](/docs/started/introduction/)
   - Review the [Architecture Overview](/docs/started/architecture/)
   - Consider [trying out Kubeflow](/docs/started/installing-kubeflow/) (not required, can be challenging)
4. Review the [project ideas](#project-ideas) to decide which ones you are interested in:
   - You may wish to attend the next [community meeting](/docs/about/community/#kubeflow-community-calendar) for the group that is leading your chosen project.
   - **NOTE:** while we recommend you submit a proposal based on the project ideas, you can also submit a proposal with your own idea.
5. Submit a proposal through the [GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) between **March 16th** and **March 31st**:
   - Please see [these guidelines](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal) on how to write a good proposal.
   - Kubeflow requests that you use [this template](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/tree/master/proposals/gsoc) for your proposal. 
   - You will need to submit PDF version of your proposal on GSoC website before March 30th, 2026. 
6. Wait for the results to be announced on **May 8th**.

## Project Ideas

### Project 1: Agentic RAG on Kubeflow (Expansion of kubeflow/docs-agent)

**Components:** Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP), KServe, Manifests (Deployment/Infra), LLM Agents

**Mentors:** @chasecadet, @tarekabouzeid (Tarek Abouzeid - Kubeflow Platform)

**Contributor:** Details:

**Project Overview & Scope:** This project aims to evolve the existing kubeflow/docs-agent from a simple retrieval tool into a robust Reference Architecture for Agentic RAG on Kubeflow. Currently, the tool performs basic lookups. The GSoC contributor will upgrade this to an agentic workflow that can intelligently parse user questions, access the Kubeflow Git repository and Reference Platform Architecture as tools, and provide cited, technical answers. The core goal is "Dogfooding": We want to use Kubeflow to build the AI that helps users learn Kubeflow.

**Key Deliverables (GSoC Scope):**

- **Agentic Architecture:** Implement an agent (using frameworks like LangGraph or Kagent) running on Kubeflow that can query specialized indices (Documentation, GitHub Issues, Platform Architecture).
- **Ingestion Pipelines:** Build reusable Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) to scrape, chunk, and index "Golden Data" from our reference architectures, establishing a best-practice pattern for data handling.
- **Local Serving via KServe:** Demonstrate how to serve the agent's LLM (e.g., Llama 3) using KServe on the cluster, utilizing Scale-to-Zero to handle bursty workloads efficiently.
- **Deployment Reference:** Create the Terraform/Manifests required to deploy this entire stack on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), serving as a reproducible reference for the community.

**Future Vision (Context for the Contributor):** While beyond the immediate GSoC scope, this project lays the foundation for advanced capabilities:
- **Fine-Tuning & Routing:** Future iterations will use KFP to fine-tune specialized "Router" models that direct queries to specific agents.
- **Security (MCP & Istio):** We envision integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and using Istio sidecars to secure agent-to-tool communication.

The GSoC contributor is building the bedrock layer that these future innovations will stand upon.

**Community Value:**

- **"Golden Data" Standard:** By curating the data for this agent, we will identify gaps in our documentation and create a trusted dataset of "verified" configurations that the community can use to benchmark their own internal platforms.
- **Helm Alignment:** This project will validate the new community Helm charts by acting as a "consumer," providing feedback on their ease of deployment in a complex GenAI stack.
- **Platform Alignment:** We will work closely with Tarek Abouzeid to align with the Kubeflow Platform Documentation. The project must clearly separate Core Kubeflow Services (portable) from Cloud-Specific Adapters (OCI), ensuring the agentic architecture remains portable for any user.

**Ideas and references:**

- Current Repo: [kubeflow/docs-agent](https://github.com/kubeflow/docs-agent)
- Platform Standards: [Kubeflow Platform Docs](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/kubeflow-platform/)
- Infrastructure: [Terraform OCI Provider Docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs)

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Size:** 350 hours

**Skills Required/Preferred:**

- Python (Backend, Agent logic)
- Kubeflow (Pipelines, KServe)
- GenAI/LLM Ops (RAG, Vector Databases)
- Infrastructure (Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes)
- Communication (Ability to document architectural decisions clearly)

## Project 3: OptimizationJob CRD for Hyperparameter Optimization

**Components:** [kubeflow/katib](https://www.github.com/kubeflow/katib), [kubeflow/sdk](https://www.github.com/kubeflow/sdk), [kubeflow/trainer](https://www.github.com/kubeflow/trainer)

**Mentors:** [@akshaychitneni](https://github.com/akshaychitneni), [@andreyvelich](https://github.com/andreyvelich)

**Contributor:**

**Details:**

Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is critical for maximizing model performance in machine learning workflows. While Katib currently provides HPO capabilities through the `Experiment` CRD, it was designed for broad use cases including Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and arbitrary workloads.

This project aims to design and implement a new **OptimizationJob CRD** (`optimizer.kubeflow.org/v1alpha1`) specifically focused on hyperparameter optimization for TrainJobs. The new CRD will provide:

- **Tighter TrainJob Integration**: Replace unstructured trial specifications with typed TrainJob templates, enabling strong validation
- **Shared Initialization**: Implement a common initializer pattern that runs once and shares model/dataset artifacts across all trials reducing trial startup time and storage costs
- **Simplified API**: Focus exclusively on HPO use cases
- **Modern Metrics Collection**: Support push-based metrics reporting via the Kubeflow SDK
- **SDK Alignment**: Integrate with `OptimizerClient` API from [KEP-46: Hyperparameter Optimization in Kubeflow SDK](https://github.com/kubeflow/sdk/blob/main/docs/proposals/46-hyperparameter-optimization/README.md)

Tracking issue: [kubeflow/katib#2605](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/issues/2605)

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Size:** 350 hours (Large)

**Skills Required/Preferred:**
* Go
* Python
* Familiarity with Kubernetes controllers, CRDs
* Basic understanding of machine learning training workflows
* Experience with HPO frameworks
