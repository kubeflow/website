## Project Ideas

### Project 1: Agentic RAG on Kubeflow (Expansion of kubeflow/docs-agent)

**Components:** Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP), KServe, Manifests (Deployment/Infra), LLM Agents

**Mentors:** @chasecadet, @tarekabouzeid (Tarek Abouzeid - Kubeflow Platform)

**Contributor:** Details:

**Project Overview & Scope:** This project aims to evolve the existing kubeflow/docs-agent from a simple retrieval tool into a robust Reference Architecture for Agentic RAG on Kubeflow. Currently, the tool performs basic lookups. The GSoC contributor will upgrade this to an agentic workflow that can intelligently parse user questions, access the Kubeflow Git repository and Reference Platform Architecture as tools, and provide cited, technical answers. The core goal is "Dogfooding": We want to use Kubeflow to build the AI that helps users learn Kubeflow.

**Key Deliverables (GSoC Scope):**

- **Agentic Architecture:** Implement an agent (using frameworks like LangGraph or Kagent) running on Kubeflow that can query specialized indices (Documentation, GitHub Issues, Platform Architecture).
- **Ingestion Pipelines:** Build reusable Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) to scrape, chunk, and index "Golden Data" from our reference architectures, establishing a best-practice pattern for data handling.
- **Local Serving via KServe:** Demonstrate how to serve the agent's LLM (e.g., Llama 3) using KServe on the cluster, utilizing Scale-to-Zero to handle bursty workloads efficiently.
- **Deployment Reference:** Create the Terraform/Manifests required to deploy this entire stack on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), serving as a reproducible reference for the community.

**Future Vision (Context for the Contributor):** While beyond the immediate GSoC scope, this project lays the foundation for advanced capabilities:
- **Fine-Tuning & Routing:** Future iterations will use KFP to fine-tune specialized "Router" models that direct queries to specific agents.
- **Security (MCP & Istio):** We envision integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and using Istio sidecars to secure agent-to-tool communication.

The GSoC contributor is building the bedrock layer that these future innovations will stand upon.

**Community Value:**

- **"Golden Data" Standard:** By curating the data for this agent, we will identify gaps in our documentation and create a trusted dataset of "verified" configurations that the community can use to benchmark their own internal platforms.
- **Helm Alignment:** This project will validate the new community Helm charts by acting as a "consumer," providing feedback on their ease of deployment in a complex GenAI stack.
- **Platform Alignment:** We will work closely with Tarek Abouzeid to align with the Kubeflow Platform Documentation. The project must clearly separate Core Kubeflow Services (portable) from Cloud-Specific Adapters (OCI), ensuring the agentic architecture remains portable for any user.

**Ideas and references:**

- Current Repo: [kubeflow/docs-agent](https://github.com/kubeflow/docs-agent)
- Platform Standards: [Kubeflow Platform Docs](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/kubeflow-platform/)
- Infrastructure: [Terraform OCI Provider Docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs)

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Size:** 350 hours

**Skills Required/Preferred:**

- Python (Backend, Agent logic)
- Kubeflow (Pipelines, KServe)
- GenAI/LLM Ops (RAG, Vector Databases)
- Infrastructure (Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes)
- Communication (Ability to document architectural decisions clearly)

## Project 3: OptimizationJob CRD for Hyperparameter Optimization

**Components:** [kubeflow/katib](https://www.github.com/kubeflow/katib), [kubeflow/sdk](https://www.github.com/kubeflow/sdk), [kubeflow/trainer](https://www.github.com/kubeflow/trainer)

**Mentors:** [@akshaychitneni](https://github.com/akshaychitneni), [@andreyvelich](https://github.com/andreyvelich)

**Contributor:**

**Details:**

Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is critical for maximizing model performance in machine learning workflows. While Katib currently provides HPO capabilities through the `Experiment` CRD, it was designed for broad use cases including Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and arbitrary workloads.

This project aims to design and implement a new **OptimizationJob CRD** (`optimizer.kubeflow.org/v1alpha1`) specifically focused on hyperparameter optimization for TrainJobs. The new CRD will provide:

- **Tighter TrainJob Integration**: Replace unstructured trial specifications with typed TrainJob templates, enabling strong validation
- **Shared Initialization**: Implement a common initializer pattern that runs once and shares model/dataset artifacts across all trials reducing trial startup time and storage costs
- **Simplified API**: Focus exclusively on HPO use cases
- **Modern Metrics Collection**: Support push-based metrics reporting via the Kubeflow SDK
- **SDK Alignment**: Integrate with `OptimizerClient` API from [KEP-46: Hyperparameter Optimization in Kubeflow SDK](https://github.com/kubeflow/sdk/blob/main/docs/proposals/46-hyperparameter-optimization/README.md)

Tracking issue: [kubeflow/katib#2605](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/issues/2605)

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Size:** 350 hours (Large)

**Skills Required/Preferred:**
* Go
* Python
* Familiarity with Kubernetes controllers, CRDs
* Basic understanding of machine learning training workflows
* Experience with HPO frameworks

## Project #: End-to-End ARM64 Support & Validation on Kubeflow

**Components:** Manifests (Platform), Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP), Katib, Notebooks, Trainer

**Mentors:** @chasecadet, @jtu-ampere (Mentor) 

**Owning Team:** ARM Contributions Team 

**Contributor:** 

**Details:**

**Context & Vision:**
 As development teams increasingly move to Apple Silicon ([M-series chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon#M-series_SoCs)) and production workloads shift to cost-efficient ARM-based cloud instances (like [OCI Ampere](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/arm/), [Google Axion](https://cloud.google.com/products/axion), and [AWS Graviton](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) ), ARM64 support is a critical requirement for the future of Kubeflow.

Currently, support is fragmented. The ARM Contributions Team aims to close this gap by establishing First-Class Citizen support for ARM64 across the entire Kubeflow Reference Platform. This initiative is not just about compiling binaries; it is about validating the "Kubeflow Platform" experience to ensure it is robust, reproducible, and ready for diverse environments.

**Strategic Alignment:**
This work directly supports the Kubeflow Platform Definition. By validating the end-to-end platform on non-x86 architectures, the team serves as a critical quality gate, ensuring that "Kubeflow" remains a consistent standard regardless of the underlying hardware.

**Collaboration & History:**

This project builds upon the extensive groundwork laid by the ARM Support Team, who have previously validated and built many of these images. The goal is to upstream this foundational work—porting validated Dockerfiles, build flags, and image tags into the official Kubeflow repositories—effectively making the community's "best effort" success the official standard.
Scope & Deliverables

**Scope & Deliverables:**
1. Multi-Arch Build System (CI/CD)

    **Audit & Standardization:** The team will identify every container image in the official kubeflow/manifests release that lacks an ARM64 variant.

    **Pipeline Implementation:** Update build systems (GitHub Actions/Prow) to generate multi-arch manifests (AMD64/ARM64) automatically on release. The goal is a single tag (e.g., :v2.0.0) that pulls the correct image for the host architecture.

2. Platform Manifest Validation

    **Architecture Agnosticism:** Ensure official Kustomize manifests do not hardcode architecture-specific SHA hashes or incompatible image tags, ensuring the manifests apply cleanly regardless of the node architecture.

3. Infrastructure: Cloud & Edge

    **Cloud Validation (OCI):** Leverage Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Ampere A1 instances to maintain a persistent "Golden" test environment.

    **Stretch Goal:** On-Premise & Edge Demonstration: A key stretch goal for this team is to demonstrate Kubeflow running on on-premise ARM hardware.

    **The "Why":** This serves as the ultimate proof of Kubeflow's portability. By successfully deploying to an edge environment (outside of managed cloud services), we demonstrate that Kubeflow is truly infrastructure-agnostic and ready for Edge AI use cases.

4. End-to-End (E2E) Platform QA

    **Full Suite Testing:** Run the full Kubeflow End-to-End test suite on ARM infrastructure to catch architecture-specific bugs (e.g., generic libc dependencies, JIT compiler issues in TensorFlow/PyTorch).

    **Documentation & "Golden Data":** Generate a "Golden Data" set of known-good configurations for running Kubeflow on ARM. This includes documentation on "gotchas" for users running local development clusters on Apple Silicon (Kind/Minikube).

**Difficulty:** Medium/Hard (Depends on CI/CD complexity) 

**Size:** 350 hours

**Tracking & References:**
   
* KFP Issue: [Build and publish ARM images for KFP #10309](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/issues/10309)  
* Manifests Issue: [Support for the aarch64 architecture #2745](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/issues/2745)

**Team Capabilities & Stack:**

* Docker/Containerization: Deep understanding of multi-arch builds (docker buildx, manifests).
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions (primary), Prow (secondary).
* Kubernetes: Kustomize, Manifest management.
* Go/Python: Ability to debug build scripts and genericize code that assumes x86 architecture.
* Infrastructure: Familiarity with cloud instances and bare-metal/edge hardware configuration.
