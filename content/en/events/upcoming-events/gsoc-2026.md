## Project Ideas

### Project 1: Agentic RAG on Kubeflow (Expansion of kubeflow/docs-agent)

**Components:** Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP), KServe, Manifests (Deployment/Infra), LLM Agents

**Mentors:** @chasecadet, @tarekabouzeid (Tarek Abouzeid - Kubeflow Platform)

**Contributor:** Details:

**Project Overview & Scope:** This project aims to evolve the existing kubeflow/docs-agent from a simple retrieval tool into a robust Reference Architecture for Agentic RAG on Kubeflow. Currently, the tool performs basic lookups. The GSoC contributor will upgrade this to an agentic workflow that can intelligently parse user questions, access the Kubeflow Git repository and Reference Platform Architecture as tools, and provide cited, technical answers. The core goal is "Dogfooding": We want to use Kubeflow to build the AI that helps users learn Kubeflow.

**Key Deliverables (GSoC Scope):**

- **Agentic Architecture:** Implement an agent (using frameworks like LangGraph or Kagent) running on Kubeflow that can query specialized indices (Documentation, GitHub Issues, Platform Architecture).
- **Ingestion Pipelines:** Build reusable Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) to scrape, chunk, and index "Golden Data" from our reference architectures, establishing a best-practice pattern for data handling.
- **Local Serving via KServe:** Demonstrate how to serve the agent's LLM (e.g., Llama 3) using KServe on the cluster, utilizing Scale-to-Zero to handle bursty workloads efficiently.
- **Deployment Reference:** Create the Terraform/Manifests required to deploy this entire stack on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), serving as a reproducible reference for the community.

**Future Vision (Context for the Contributor):** While beyond the immediate GSoC scope, this project lays the foundation for advanced capabilities:
- **Fine-Tuning & Routing:** Future iterations will use KFP to fine-tune specialized "Router" models that direct queries to specific agents.
- **Security (MCP & Istio):** We envision integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and using Istio sidecars to secure agent-to-tool communication.

The GSoC contributor is building the bedrock layer that these future innovations will stand upon.

**Community Value:**

- **"Golden Data" Standard:** By curating the data for this agent, we will identify gaps in our documentation and create a trusted dataset of "verified" configurations that the community can use to benchmark their own internal platforms.
- **Helm Alignment:** This project will validate the new community Helm charts by acting as a "consumer," providing feedback on their ease of deployment in a complex GenAI stack.
- **Platform Alignment:** We will work closely with Tarek Abouzeid to align with the Kubeflow Platform Documentation. The project must clearly separate Core Kubeflow Services (portable) from Cloud-Specific Adapters (OCI), ensuring the agentic architecture remains portable for any user.

**Ideas and references:**

- Current Repo: [kubeflow/docs-agent](https://github.com/kubeflow/docs-agent)
- Platform Standards: [Kubeflow Platform Docs](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/kubeflow-platform/)
- Infrastructure: [Terraform OCI Provider Docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs)

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Size:** 350 hours

**Skills Required/Preferred:**

- Python (Backend, Agent logic)
- Kubeflow (Pipelines, KServe)
- GenAI/LLM Ops (RAG, Vector Databases)
- Infrastructure (Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes)
- Communication (Ability to document architectural decisions clearly) 

### Project 2: OptimizationJob CRD for Hyperparameter Optimization

**Components:** [kubeflow/katib](https://www.github.com/kubeflow/katib), [kubeflow/sdk](https://www.github.com/kubeflow/sdk), [kubeflow/trainer](https://www.github.com/kubeflow/trainer)

**Mentors:** [@akshaychitneni](https://github.com/akshaychitneni), [@andreyvelich](https://github.com/andreyvelich)

**Contributor:**

**Details:**

Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is critical for maximizing model performance in machine learning workflows. While Katib currently provides HPO capabilities through the `Experiment` CRD, it was designed for broad use cases including Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and arbitrary workloads.

This project aims to design and implement a new **OptimizationJob CRD** (`optimizer.kubeflow.org/v1alpha1`) specifically focused on hyperparameter optimization for TrainJobs. The new CRD will provide:

- **Tighter TrainJob Integration**: Replace unstructured trial specifications with typed TrainJob templates, enabling strong validation
- **Shared Initialization**: Implement a common initializer pattern that runs once and shares model/dataset artifacts across all trials reducing trial startup time and storage costs
- **Simplified API**: Focus exclusively on HPO use cases
- **Modern Metrics Collection**: Support push-based metrics reporting via the Kubeflow SDK
- **SDK Alignment**: Integrate with `OptimizerClient` API from [KEP-46: Hyperparameter Optimization in Kubeflow SDK](https://github.com/kubeflow/sdk/blob/main/docs/proposals/46-hyperparameter-optimization/README.md)

Tracking issue: [kubeflow/katib#2605](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/issues/2605)

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Size:** 350 hours (Large)

**Skills Required/Preferred:**
* Go
* Python
* Familiarity with Kubernetes controllers, CRDs
* Basic understanding of machine learning training workflows
* Experience with HPO frameworks

### Project 3: KServe Models Web Application

**Components:** Kserve, Kubeflow Common Library, Kubeflow Dashboard

**Mentors:** [Griffin Sullivan](https://github.com/Griffin-Sullivan), [Harshit Nayan](https://github.com/LogicalGuy77), [Dhanisha Phadate](https://github.com/dhanishaphadate)

**Contributor:** 

**Details:** The project includes improving test coverage and cleanup, adding end-to-end and deployment-level testing, and validating the application through full deployment workflows. It also migrates the repository from KServe to Kubeflow and extends the UI to support KServe v0.16/0.17 features, including [LLMInferenceService](https://kserve.github.io/website/docs/model-serving/generative-inference/llmisvc/llmisvc-overview) and [InferenceGraph](https://kserve.github.io/website/docs/model-serving/inferencegraph/overview).

This project modernizes the KServe Models Web Application by upgrading Angular from v14 to v16+. The Kubeflow common library will be upgraded first, followed by updates to Dockerfiles, Makefiles, workflows and documentation.

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Size:** 350 hours

**Skills Required/Preferred:**

- Angular & TypeScript
- Kubernetes and CRDs
- Docker and CI/CD
- Kubeflow / KServe (preferred)

### Project 4: Platform Scalability and Security

**Components:** Kubeflow Manifests, Kubeflow Pipelines, Kubeflow Training Operator

**Mentors:** [Julius von Kohout](https://github.com/juliusvonkohout)

**Contributor:** 

**Details:** As Kubeflow scales to environments with 1,000+ namespaces, core bottlenecks emerge. This project focuses on optimizing CRD controllers, improving multi-tenancy security, and hardening the platform. Key work areas include: refactoring the Profile Controller to use Metacontroller for a cleaner plugin system, migrating from Istio Gateway to the Kubernetes Gateway API and enabling Model Registry by default. Many CRD controllers are written inefficiently and struggle with the reconciliation load or block the Kubernetes API server with too many requests.
Using "Kubernetes user namespaces" for PSS baseline in the level in PSS restricted will also be an explorative task.

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Size:** 350 hours

### Project 5: Helm Charts

**Components:** Kubeflow Manifests, Kubeflow Pipelines, Kubeflow Katib

**Mentors:** [Julius von Kohout](https://github.com/juliusvonkohout), [Humair Khan](https://github.com/HumairAK), [Dhanisha Phadate](https://github.com/dhanishaphadate)

**Contributor:** 

**Details:** This project continues the KSC-approved initiative to provide Kubeflow platform and standalone components via Helm. The goal is to move beyond Kustomize-only deployments to offer minimalistic, maintainable Helm charts that reflect Kustomize defaults 1:1. Key tasks include: developing and testing Helm charts for KFP and Katib, implementing CI/CD testing infrastructure for Helm-based deployments and coordinating with component maintainers to ensure cross-project consistency.
juliusvonkohout marked this conversation as resolved.

This project will touch most components and continue the helm chart initiative started by @kunal-511 who also helped a lot with the testing infrastructure.
This will therefore also include working with maintainers of other components such as KFP maintainersfor the KFP helm charts, security and scalability topic or Katib maintainers for Katib helm charts. Some have already open PRs and there was a formal vote by the KSC (Kubeflow steering Committee) that we are moving forward with offering Kubeflow platform and standalone components as helm charts. Therefore it is not just the technical part, but also the coordination effort. The goal is to make minimalistic helm charts that are easy to maintain next to kustomize and only expose sensible settings relevant to most users. For the time being the rendered chart default values must replicate kustomize 1:1. The testing infrastructure has already been set up in the GSOC 2025 efforts in kubeflow/mnaifests where we already have a few helm charts.
