**Difficulty:** Hard

**Size:** 350 hours

**Goals:**

- Integrating the [Batch Processing Gateway (BPG)](https://github.com/apple/batch-processing-gateway) with Kubeflow for submitting, monitoring, and managing Spark applications across multiple clusters ([`kubeflow/spark-operator#2422`](https://github.com/kubeflow/spark-operator/issues/2422))
- Analyse, Design, Plan, and Execute Spark Job Execution Strategies:
  - Evaluate the trade-offs between running a Spark kernel directly within a Kubeflow Notebook versus leveraging the Batch Processing Gateway for job submission.
  - Assess the cloud-native design of Kubeflow SDK and Notebook environments to determine the optimal approach for Spark integration that maximizes efficiency, scalability, and usability.
  - Make a well-informed decision on whether to support Spark kernels within notebooks, use BPG, or implement a hybrid approach for an enhanced user experience.
- Automated Job Routing and Scalable Execution:
  - Implement dynamic workload routing using BPG to automatically distribute Spark jobs based on cluster load, resource availability, and workload priority.
  - Integrate with the Spark Operator to optimize resource allocation, minimize execution delays, and ensure efficient scaling for petabyte-scale machine learning and data processing workloads.
- Enhanced User API and Notebook Integration:
  - Develop a Python SDK for Kubeflow notebooks, enabling users to submit, manage, and monitor Spark jobs via BPG REST APIs for a lightweight, scalable solution.
  - Ensure a seamless user experience by providing intuitive APIs that abstract complex job management operations, making it easier for data scientists and ML engineers to experiment and iterate on workflows within
- Comprehensive Debugging and Performance Monitoring:
  - Enable full debugging capabilities by integrating Spark UI, logging, and monitoring tools into Kubeflow, allowing users to visualize Spark DAGs, tasks, and execution stages.
  - Implement centralized logging and Prometheus-based monitoring to provide real-time insights into Spark job performance across clusters.
  - Ensure users can efficiently analyze job execution, detect bottlenecks, and optimize data processing and ML workflows within Kubeflow.
  - Note: Most of the logging APIs must be leveraged out of the box from either BPG or Spark - but we need to document, showcase examples to user.
- Comprehensive documentation and user guides to assist users in leveraging the new features effectively.

**Skills Required/Preferred:**

- Proficiency in Python, Java and familiarity with developing SDKs.
- Experience with Kubernetes and managing containerized applications.
- Understanding of Apache Spark and its deployment on Kubernetes clusters.
- Familiarity with RESTful API development and integration.
- Experience with monitoring tools and logging frameworks is a plus.
