### Project 4

### Title: Deploying Kubeflow with Helm

#### Component
Kubeflow

#### Description:

Over the past several KubeCons, the number one issue from users has been the difficulty of deploying Kubeflow and the heavy dependency on various distributions for a simple setup. Currently, distributions use a mix of:

* Manifests (some written and maintained separately)  
* Operators (managed outside the Kubeflow project repositories)  
* Templating tools (Helm, Kustomize, etc.)

To improve accessibility and enable users to self-manage their own Kubeflow deployments, a community-driven Helm chart is being developed for Kubeflow v1.9, with an eventual upgrade path to v1.10. This project is designed to "cross the finish line" for the Kubeflow Helm Chart, ensuring it is a fully functional deployment method.

As part of this initiative, we aim to:

* Complete a working Helm Chart for Kubeflow 1.9  
* Ensure KServe and Knative integrations are included  
* Document the chart’s structure and configuration  
* Create a deployment walkthrough tutorial for a Kubernetes distribution of choice

By working on this project, contributors will improve the ability for end users to deploy Kubeflow in their own environments without relying on third-party distributions, making it easier to evaluate, customize, and scale.

#### Why This Project Matters?

For many enterprises and researchers, deploying Kubeflow remains a major challenge. By completing the official Kubeflow Helm Chart, this project will:

* Reduce dependency on custom distributions  
* Lower the barrier to entry for new users  
* Enable self-managed deployments for evaluation and production  
* Foster stronger adoption of Kubeflow in the open-source community

#### Component:
- Kubeflow
- Batch Processing Gateway
- Apache Spark Operator
- Kubeflow SDK proposal

#### Description:
Managing Apache Spark jobs in a multi-cluster Kubernetes environment presents several challenges, including inefficient workload distribution, performance bottlenecks, and debugging complexities. Kubeflow users working with large-scale data processing and machine learning workflows require a streamlined, cloud-native experience that optimizes Spark job execution, monitoring, and debugging.
This project proposes integrating the Batch Processing Gateway (BPG) with Kubeflow to enable an efficient, scalable, and centralized approach for submitting, monitoring, and managing Spark applications across multiple clusters. By enhancing the API and user experience, this integration will provide seamless job routing, performance tracking, and debugging capabilities while reducing the computational burden on Kubeflow notebooks.

By undertaking this project, contributors will play a crucial role in enhancing the performance, efficiency, and usability of Spark applications within the Kubeflow ecosystem, thereby addressing current challenges in multi-cluster job management.

#### Why This Project?
By integrating Batch Processing Gateway with Kubeflow Notebooks, this project provides a cloud-native, scalable, and user-friendly solution for Spark job execution, debugging. It will significantly improve performance, efficiency, and developer experience, enabling ML practitioners and data engineers to focus on experimentation and optimization without struggling with job management complexities.

Batch Processing Gateway can help enterprise environments, managing Apache Spark jobs across multiple Kubernetes clusters presents challenges such as inefficient job distribution, performance bottlenecks, and complex workload balancing. Integrating the Batch Processing Gateway (BPG) into Kubeflow aims to address these issues by providing a centralized mechanism for submitting, monitoring, and managing Spark applications across various clusters.

#### Key Objectives:
- Analyse, Design, Plan, and Execute Spark Job Execution Strategies:
  - Evaluate the trade-offs between running a Spark kernel directly within a Kubeflow Notebook versus leveraging the Batch Processing Gateway for job submission.
  - Assess the cloud-native design of Kubeflow SDK and Notebook environments to determine the optimal approach for Spark integration that maximizes efficiency, scalability, and usability.
  -  Make a well-informed decision on whether to support Spark kernels within notebooks, use BPG, or implement a hybrid approach for an enhanced user experience.
- Automated Job Routing and Scalable Execution:
  - Implement dynamic workload routing using BPG to automatically distribute Spark jobs based on cluster load, resource availability, and workload priority.
  - Integrate with the Spark Operator to optimize resource allocation, minimize execution delays, and ensure efficient scaling for petabyte-scale machine learning and data processing workloads.
- Enhanced User API and Notebook Integration:
  - Develop a Python SDK for Kubeflow notebooks, enabling users to submit, manage, and monitor Spark jobs via BPG REST APIs for a lightweight, scalable solution.
  - Ensure a seamless user experience by providing intuitive APIs that abstract complex job management operations, making it easier for data scientists and ML engineers to experiment and iterate on workflows within
- Comprehensive Debugging and Performance Monitoring:
  - Enable full debugging capabilities by integrating Spark UI, logging, and monitoring tools into Kubeflow, allowing users to visualize Spark DAGs, tasks, and execution stages.
  - Implement centralized logging and Prometheus-based monitoring to provide real-time insights into Spark job performance across clusters.
  - Ensure users can efficiently analyze job execution, detect bottlenecks, and optimize data processing and ML workflows within Kubeflow.
  - Note: Most of the logging APIs must be leveraged out of the box from either BPG or Spark - but we need to document, show case examples to user.

Mentors expecting GSoC project execution plan - phase wise with weekly milestone that student want to achieve.

#### Expected Outcomes:
- A robust integration of BPG into the Kubeflow ecosystem, enabling efficient Spark job management across multiple clusters.
- A Python SDK compatible with Kubeflow notebooks to facilitate Spark job submission through BPG, offering a scalable solution that reduces notebook load and enhances performance.

### Project 9
### Title: Support Kubernetes Sidecars for Katib Metrics Collectors
#### Component: Kubeflow Katib

#### Description
Open issue: kubeflow/katib#2181

Katib implements Pull-based Metrics Collector as a sidecar container to collect training metrics from the Trials once training is complete. However, the Pull-based Metrics Collector has some problems. For example, the Trial will fail if the training container is finished before Metrics Collector is started.
After v1.28, Kubernetes add native support for sidecar containers as part of KEP 753, which allows us to launch sidecar containers before the training container. In order to address the problems with the Pull-based Metrics Collector, we need to support Kubernetes Sidecar Containers in Katib.
