This guide describes how to use `kubectl` and [kpt](https://googlecontainertools.github.io/kpt/) to
deploy Kubeflow on Google Cloud.

## Before you start

Before installing Kubeflow on the command line:


1. You must have created a management cluster and installed Config Connector.

   * If you don't have a management cluster follow the [instructions](../management-setup/)

   * Your management cluster must have a namespace setup to administer the Google Cloud project where
Kubeflow will be deployed. Follow the [instructions](../management-setup/) to create
one if you haven't already.

1. If you're using
  [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/), enable
  [boost mode](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/features#boost_mode).

1. Make sure that your Google Cloud project meets the minimum requirements
  described in the [project setup guide](/docs/gke/deploy/project-setup/).

1. Follow the guide
  [setting up OAuth credentials](/docs/gke/deploy/oauth-setup/)
  to create OAuth credentials for [Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy (Cloud
  IAP)](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/).


### Install the required tools

1. Install [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).

1. Install gcloud components

   ```
   gcloud components install kpt anthoscli beta
   gcloud components update
   ```

1. Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

1. Install [Kustomize v3.2.1](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/kustomize%2Fv3.2.1).

    Note, Kubeflow is not compatible with later versions of Kustomize. Read [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/issues/538) for the latest status.

1. Install [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)

   ```
   GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/mikefarah/yq/v3
   ```

   * If you don't have [Go](https://golang.org) installed you can download
     a binary from [yq's GitHub releases](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases).

1.  Follow the instructions from [Preparing to install Anthos Service Mesh](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/archive/1.4/docs/gke-install-new-cluster#preparing_to_install_anthos_service_mesh) to install `istioctl`.

    Note, the `istioctl` downloaded from above instructions is specific to Anthos Service Mesh. It is different from the `istioctl` you can download on https://istio.io/.

## Prepare your environment

1. Log in. You only need to run this command once:

    ```
    gcloud auth login
    ```

## Fetch packages using kpt

1. Fetch the blueprint

   ```
   kpt pkg get https://github.com/kubeflow/gcp-blueprints.git/kubeflow@v1.1.0 ./${KFDIR}
   ```

   * You can choose any name you would like for the directory ${KFDIR}

1. Change to the Kubeflow directory

   ```
   cd ${KFDIR}
   ```

1. Fetch Kubeflow manifests

   ```
   make get-pkg
   ```

  * This generates an error like the one below but you can ignore it;

    ```
    kpt pkg get https://github.com/jlewi/manifests.git@blueprints ./upstream
    fetching package / from https://github.com/jlewi/manifests to upstream/manifests
    Error: resources must be annotated with config.kubernetes.io/index to be written to files
    ```

    * This is being tracked in [GoogleContainerTools/kpt#539](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt/issues/539)

## Configure Kubeflow

There are certain parameters that you must define in order to configure how and where
kubeflow is defined. These are described in the table below.

kpt setter | Description |
-----------|-------------|
mgmt-ctxt | This is the name of the KUBECONFIG context for the management cluster; this kubecontext will be used to create CNRM resources for your Kubeflow deployment. **The context must set the namespace to the namespace in your CNRM cluster where you are creating CNRM resources for the managed project.**|
gcloud.core.project| The project you want to deploy in |
location | The zone or region you want to deploy in |
gcloud.compute.region | The region you are deploying in |
gcloud.compute.zone | The zone to use for zonal resources; must be in gcloud.compute.region |

* Location can be a zone or a region depending on whether you want a regional cluster

  * Currently, Kubeflow Pipelines doesn't work with regional deployments. For more, go to [kubeflow/gcp-blueprints#6](https://github.com/kubeflow/gcp-blueprints/issues/6).

* The **Makefile** at `${KFDIR}/kubeflow/Makefile` contains a rule `set-values` with appropriate `kpt cfg` commands to set the values
  of the parameters

* You need to edit the makefile at `${KFDIR}/kubeflow/Makefile` to set the parameters to the desired values.

   * Note there are multiple invocations of `kpt cfg set` on different directories to
     work around [GoogleContainerTools/kpt#541](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt/issues/541)

* You need to configure the kubectl context provided in `mgmt-ctxt`.

  * Choose the management cluster context
    ```bash
    kubectl config use-context ${mgmt-ctxt}
    ```

  * Create a namespace in your management cluster for the managed project if you haven't done so.
    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace ${PROJECT}
    ```

  * Make the managed project's namespace default of the context:
    ```bash
    kubectl config set-context --current --namespace ${PROJECT}
    ```

* If you haven't previously created an OAuth client for IAP then follow
  the [directions](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/gke/deploy/oauth-setup/) to setup
  your consent screen and oauth client.

  * Unfortunately [GKE's BackendConfig](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/backendconfig)
    currently doesn't support creating [IAP OAuth clients programmatically](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/programmatic-oauth-clients).

*  Set environment variables with OAuth Client ID and Secret for IAP

   ```
   export CLIENT_ID=<Your CLIENT_ID>
   export CLIENT_SECRET=<Your CLIENT_SECRET>
   ```

* Invoke the make rule to set the kpt setters

  ```
  make set-values
  ```

## Deploy Kubeflow

To deploy Kubeflow, run the following command:

```
make apply
```

* If resources can't be created because `webhook.cert-manager.io` is unavailable wait and
  then rerun `make apply`

  * This issue is being tracked in [kubeflow/manifests#1234](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/issues/1234)

* If resources can't be created with an error message like:

  ```
  error: unable to recognize ".build/application/app.k8s.io_v1beta1_application_application-controller-kubeflow.yaml": no matches for kind "Application" in version "app.k8s.io/v1beta1‚Äù
  ```

  This issue occurs when the CRD endpoint isn't established in the Kubernetes API server when the CRD's custom object is applied.
  This issue is expected and can happen multiple times for different kinds of resource. To resolve this issue, try running `make apply` again.


## Check your deployment

Follow these steps to verify the deployment:

1. When the deployment finishes, check the resources installed in the namespace
   `kubeflow` in your new cluster.  To do this from the command line, first set
   your `kubectl` credentials to point to the new cluster:

    ```
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${KF_NAME} --zone ${ZONE} --project ${PROJECT}
    ```

    Then see what's installed in the `kubeflow` namespace of your GKE cluster:

    ```
    kubectl -n kubeflow get all
    ```

## Access the Kubeflow user interface (UI)

To access the Kubeflow central dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Use the following command to grant yourself the [IAP-secured Web App User](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/managing-access) role:

    ```
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT] --member=user:[EMAIL] --role=roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor
    ```

    Note, you need the `IAP-secured Web App User` role even if you are already an owner or editor of the project. `IAP-secured Web App User` role is not implied by the `Project Owner` or `Project Editor` roles.

1. Enter the following URI into your browser address bar. It can take 20
  minutes for the URI to become available:

    ```
    https://<KF_NAME>.endpoints.<project-id>.cloud.goog/
    ```

    You can run the following command to get the URI for your deployment:

    ```
    kubectl -n istio-system get ingress
    NAME            HOSTS                                                      ADDRESS         PORTS   AGE
    envoy-ingress   your-kubeflow-name.endpoints.your-gcp-project.cloud.goog   34.102.232.34   80      5d13h
    ```

    The following command sets an environment variable named `HOST` to the URI:

    ```
    export HOST=$(kubectl -n istio-system get ingress envoy-ingress -o=jsonpath={.spec.rules[0].host})
    ```

1. Follow the instructions on the UI to create a namespace. Refer to this guide on
  [creation of profiles](/docs/components/multi-tenancy/getting-started/#automatic-creation-of-profiles).

Notes:

* It can take 20 minutes for the URI to become available.
  Kubeflow needs to provision a signed SSL certificate and register a DNS
  name.
* If you own or manage the domain or a subdomain with
  [Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/)
  then you can configure this process to be much faster.
  See [kubeflow/kubeflow#731](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/731).


## Update Kubeflow

To update Kubeflow

1. Edit the Makefile at `${KFDIR}/kubeflow/Makefile` and change `MANIFESTS_URL` to point at the version of Kubeflow manifests you
   want to use

   * Refer to the [kpt docs](https://googlecontainertools.github.io/kpt/reference/pkg/) for
     more info about supported dependencies

1. Update the local copies

   ```
   make update
   ```

1. Redeploy

   ```
   make apply
   ```

To evaluate the changes before deploying them you can run `make hydrate` and then compare the contents
of `.build` to what is currently deployed.

## Understanding the deployment process

This section gives you more details about the kfctl configuration and
deployment process, so that you can customize your Kubeflow deployment if
necessary.

### Application layout

Your Kubeflow application directory **${KFDIR}** contains the following files and
directories:

* **upstream** is a directory containing kustomize packages for deploying Kubeflow

  * This directory contains the upstream configurations on which your deployment
    is based

* **instance** is a directory that defines overlays that are applied to the upstream
  configurations in order to customize Kubeflow for your use case.

  * **gcp_config** is a kustomize package defining all the Google Cloud resources needed for Kubeflow
    using [Cloud Config Connector](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview)

    * You can edit this kustomize package in order to customize the Google Cloud resources for
      your purposes

  * **kustomize** contains kustomize packages for the various Kubernetes applications
    to be installed on your Kubeflow cluster

* **.build** is a directory that will contain the hydrated manifests outputted by
  the `make` rules

### Source Control

It is recommended that you check in your entire **${KFDIR}** into source control.

Checking in **.build** is recommended so you can easily see differences in manifests before applying them.


### Google Cloud service accounts

The kfctl deployment process creates three service accounts in your
Google Cloud project. These service accounts follow the [principle of least
privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege).
The service accounts are:

* `${KF_NAME}-admin` is used for some admin tasks like configuring the load
  balancers. The principle is that this account is needed to deploy Kubeflow but
  not needed to actually run jobs.
* `${KF_NAME}-user` is intended to be used by training jobs and models to access
  Google Cloud resources (Cloud Storage, BigQuery, etc.). This account has a much smaller
  set of privileges compared to `admin`.
* `${KF_NAME}-vm` is used only for the virtual machine (VM) service account. This
  account has the minimal permissions needed to send metrics and logs to
  [Stackdriver](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/).


## Next steps

* Run a full ML workflow on Kubeflow, using the
  [end-to-end MNIST tutorial](/docs/gke/gcp-e2e/) or the
  [GitHub issue summarization Pipelines
  example](https://github.com/kubeflow/examples/tree/master/github_issue_summarization/pipelines).
* Learn how to [delete your Kubeflow deployment using the CLI](/docs/gke/deploy/delete-cli/).
* To add users to Kubeflow, go to [a dedicated section in Customizing Kubeflow on GKE](/docs/gke/customizing-gke/#add-users-to-kubeflow).
* To taylor your Kubeflow deployment on GKE, go to [Customizing Kubeflow on GKE](/docs/gke/customizing-gke/).
* For troubleshooting Kubeflow deployments on GKE, go to the [Troubleshooting deployments](/docs/gke/troubleshooting-gke/) guide.
