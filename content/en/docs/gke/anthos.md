[Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/anthos) is a hybrid and multi-cloud 
application platform developed and supported by Google. Anthos is built on
open source technologies, including Kubernetes, Istio, and Knative.

Using Anthos, you can create a consistent setup across your on-premises and 
cloud environments, helping you to automate policy and security at scale.
