This guide describes how to customize your deployment of Kubeflow on Google 
Kubernetes Engine (GKE) on Google Cloud.

## Customizing Kubeflow before deployment

The Kubeflow deployment process is divided into two steps, **build** and 
**apply**, so that you can modify your configuration before deploying your 
Kubeflow cluster.

Follow the guide to [deploying Kubeflow on Google Cloud](/docs/gke/deploy/deploy-cli/).
When you reach the 
[setup and deploy step](/docs/gke/deploy/deploy-cli/#set-up-and-deploy),
**skip the `kfctl apply` command** and run the **`kfctl build`** command 
instead, as  described in that step. Now you can edit the configuration files 
before deploying Kubeflow.

## Customizing an existing deployment

You can also customize an existing Kubeflow deployment. In that case, this 
guide assumes that you have already followed the guide to 
[deploying Kubeflow on Google Cloud](/docs/gke/deploy/deploy-cli/) and have deployed
Kubeflow to a GKE cluster.

## Before you start

This guide assumes the following settings: 

* The `${KF_DIR}` environment variable contains the path to
  your Kubeflow application directory, which holds your Kubeflow configuration 
  files. For example, `/opt/my-kubeflow/`.

  ```
  export KF_DIR=<path to your Kubeflow application directory>
  ``` 

* The `${CONFIG_FILE}` environment variable contains the path to your 
  Kubeflow configuration file.

  ```
  export CONFIG_FILE=${KF_DIR}/{{% config-file-gcp-iap %}}
  ```

* The `${KF_NAME}` environment variable contains the name of your Kubeflow 
  deployment. You can find the name in your
  `${CONFIG_FILE}` configuration file, as the value for the `metadata.name` key.

  ```
  export KF_NAME=<the name of your Kubeflow deployment>
  ```

* The `${PROJECT}` environment variable contains the ID of your Google Cloud project. 
  You can find the project ID in your
  `${CONFIG_FILE}` configuration file, as the value for the `project` key.

  ```
  export PROJECT=<your Google Cloud project ID>
  ```

* For further background about the above settings, see the guide to
  [deploying Kubeflow with the CLI](/docs/gke/deploy/deploy-cli).

## Customizing Google Cloud resources

To customize Google Cloud resources, such as your Kubernetes Engine cluster, you can 
modify the Deployment Manager configuration settings in `${KF_DIR}/gcp_config`.

After modifying your existing configuration, run the following command to apply
the changes:

```
cd ${KF_DIR}
kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG_FILE}
```

Alternatively, you can use Deployment Manager directly:

```
cd ${KF_DIR}/gcp_config
gcloud deployment-manager --project=${PROJECT} deployments update ${KF_NAME} --config=cluster-kubeflow.yaml
```

Some changes (such as the VM service account for Kubernetes Engine) can only be set at creation time; in this case you need
to tear down your deployment before recreating it:

```
cd ${KF_DIR}
kfctl delete -f ${CONFIG_FILE}
kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG_FILE}
```

## Customizing Kubernetes resources

You can use [kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) to customize Kubeflow. 
Make sure that you have the minimum required version of kustomize:
<b>{{% kustomize-min-version %}}</b> or later. For more information about
kustomize in Kubeflow, see
[how Kubeflow uses kustomize](/docs/other-guides/kustomize/).

To customize the Kubernetes resources running within the cluster, you can modify 
the kustomize manifests in `${KF_DIR}/kustomize`.

For example, to modify settings for the Jupyter web app:

1. Open `${KF_DIR}/kustomize/jupyter-web-app.yaml` in a text editor.
1. Find and replace the parameter values:
    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      ROK_SECRET_NAME: secret-rok-{username}
      UI: default
      clusterDomain: cluster.local
      policy: Always
      prefix: jupyter
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: jupyter-web-app
        kustomize.component: jupyter-web-app
      name: jupyter-web-app-parameters
      namespace: kubeflow
    ```

1. Redeploy Kubeflow using kfctl:

    ```
    cd ${KF_DIR}
    kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG_FILE}
    ```

    Or use kubectl directly:
    ```
    cd ${KF_DIR}/kustomize
    kubectl apply -f jupyter-web-app.yaml
    ```

## Common customizations

### Add users to Kubeflow

You must grant each user the minimal permission scope that allows them to 
connect to the Kubernetes cluster.

For Google Cloud, you should grant the following Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles.

In the following commands, replace `[PROJECT]` with your Google Cloud project and replace `[EMAIL]` with the user's email address:

* To access the Kubernetes cluster, the user needs the [Kubernetes Engine 
  Cluster Viewer](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/iam)
  role:

    ```
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT] --member=user:[EMAIL] --role=roles/container.clusterViewer
    ```

* To access the Kubeflow UI through IAP, the user needs the
  [IAP-secured Web App User](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/managing-access)
  role:

    ```
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT] --member=user:[EMAIL] --role=roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor
    ```

    Note, you need to grant the user `IAP-secured Web App User` role even if the user is already an owner or editor of the project. `IAP-secured Web App User` role is not implied by the `Project Owner` or `Project Editor` roles.

* To be able to run `gcloud container clusters get-credentials` and see logs in Cloud Logging
  (formerly Stackdriver), the user needs viewer access on the project:

    ```
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT] --member=user:[EMAIL] --role=roles/viewer
    ```

Alternatively, you can also grant these roles on the [IAM page in the Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam). Make sure you are in the same project as your Kubeflow deployment.

### Add GPU nodes to your cluster

To add GPU accelerators to your Kubeflow cluster, you have the following
options:

* Pick a Google Cloud zone that provides NVIDIA Tesla K80 Accelerators 
  (`nvidia-tesla-k80`).
* Or disable node-autoprovisioning in your Kubeflow cluster.
* Or change your node-autoprovisioning configuration.

To see which accelerators are available in each zone, run the following
command:

```
gcloud compute accelerator-types list
```
 
To disable node-autoprovisioning, run `kfctl build` as described above.
Then edit `${KF_DIR}/gcp_config/cluster-kubeflow.yaml` and set 
[`enabled`](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/4d2939d6c1a5fd862610382fde130cad33bfef75/gcp/deployment_manager_configs/cluster-kubeflow.yaml#L73) 
to `false`:

```
    ...
    gpu-type: nvidia-tesla-k80
    autoprovisioning-config:
      enabled: false
    ...
```

You must also set 
[`gpu-pool-initialNodeCount`](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/4d2939d6c1a5fd862610382fde130cad33bfef75/gcp/deployment_manager_configs/cluster-kubeflow.yaml#L58).

### Add GPU node pool to an existing kubeflow cluster

You can add a GPU node pool to your kubeflow cluster using the following command
```
export GPU_POOL_NAME=<name of the new gpu pool>

gcloud container node-pools create ${GPU_POOL_NAME} \
--accelerator type=nvidia-tesla-k80,count=1 \
--zone us-central1-a --cluster ${KF_NAME} \
--num-nodes=1 --machine-type=n1-standard-4 --min-nodes=0 --max-nodes=5 --enable-autoscaling
```

After adding GPU nodes to your cluster, you need to install NVIDIA's device drivers to the nodes. Google provides a DaemonSet that automatically installs the drivers for you.

To deploy the installation DaemonSet, run the following command:
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/container-engine-accelerators/master/nvidia-driver-installer/cos/daemonset-preloaded.yaml
```

### Add Cloud TPUs to your cluster

Set [`enable_tpu:true`](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/4d2939d6c1a5fd862610382fde130cad33bfef75/gcp/deployment_manager_configs/cluster-kubeflow.yaml#L80)
in `${KF_DIR}/gcp_config/cluster-kubeflow.yaml`.


### Specify a minimum CPU

Certain instruction sets or hardware features are only available on specific CPUs, so to ensure your cluster utilizes the appropriate hardware you need to set a minimum CPU value. 

In brief, inside `gcp_config/cluster.jinja` change the `minCpuPlatform` property for the CPU node pool. For example, `Intel Broadwell` becomes `Intel Skylake`. Setting a minimum CPU needs to occur during cluster/node creation; it cannot be applied to an existing cluster/node.

More detailed instructions follow.

* Choose a zone you want to deploy in that has your required CPU. Zones are listed in the [Regions and Zones documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/).

* Deploy Kubeflow normally as specified in the ["Deploy using CLI" documentation](/docs/gke/deploy/deploy-cli/), but stop at section ["Set up and deploy Kubeflow"](/docs/gke/deploy/deploy-cli/#set-up-and-deploy-kubeflow). Instead, navigate to section ["Alternatively, set up your configuration for later deployment"](/docs/gke/deploy/deploy-cli/#alternatively-set-up-your-configuration-for-later-deployment). Then follow the steps until you are instructed to edit configuration files.

* Navigate to the `gcp_config directory` and open the `cluster.jinja` file. Change the cluster property `minCpuPlatform`. For example, from `Intel Broadwell` to `Intel Skylake`. Note: you may notice there are two minCpuPlatform properties in the file. One of them is for GPU node pools. Not all CPU/GPU combinations are compatible, so leave the GPU minCpuPlatform property untouched.

* Follow the remaining steps of ["Alternatively, set up your configuration for later deployment"](/docs/gke/deploy/deploy-cli/#alternatively-set-up-your-configuration-for-later-deployment).


### Add VMs with more CPUs or RAM

  * Change the machineType.
  * There are two node pools defined in the Google Cloud Deployment Manager:
      * one for CPU only machines, in [`cluster.jinja`](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/tree/{{< params "githubbranch" >}}/gcp/deployment_manager_configs/cluster.jinja#L114).
      * one for GPU machines, in [`cluster.jinja`](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/tree/{{< params "githubbranch" >}}/gcp/deployment_manager_configs/cluster.jinja#L140).
  * When making changes to the node pools you also need to bump the `pool-version` in [`cluster-kubeflow.yaml`](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/tree/{{< params "githubbranch" >}}/gcp/deployment_manager_configs/cluster-kubeflow.yaml#L46) before you update the deployment.
