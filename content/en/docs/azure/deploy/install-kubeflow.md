This guide describes how to use the kfctl binary to
deploy Kubeflow on Azure.

## Prerequisites

-   Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-on-linux)
-   Install and configure the [Azure Command Line Interface (Az)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
	-  Log in with ```az login```
-   (Optional) Install Docker
	-   For Windows and WSL: [Guide](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/setting-up-docker-for-windows-and-wsl-to-work-flawlessly)
	-   For other OS: [Docker Desktop](https://hub.docker.com/?overlay=onboarding)

You do not need to have an existing Azure Resource Group or Cluster for AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service). You can create a cluster in the deployment process.

## Understanding the deployment process

The deployment process is controlled by the following commands:

* **build** - (Optional) Creates configuration files defining the various
  resources in your deployment. You only need to run `kfctl build` if you want
  to edit the resources before running `kfctl apply`.
* **apply** - Creates or updates the resources.
* **delete** - Deletes the resources.

### App layout

Your Kubeflow application directory **${KF_DIR}** contains the following files and 
directories:

* **${CONFIG_FILE}** is a YAML file that defines configurations related to your 
  Kubeflow deployment.

  * This file is a copy of the GitHub-based configuration YAML file that
    you used when deploying Kubeflow. For example, {{% config-uri-k8s-istio %}}.
  * When you run `kfctl apply` or `kfctl build`, kfctl creates
    a local version of the configuration file, `${CONFIG_FILE}`,
    which you can further customize if necessary.

* **kustomize** is a directory that contains the kustomize packages for Kubeflow applications.
    * The directory is created when you run `kfctl build` or `kfctl apply`.
    * You can customize the Kubernetes resources (modify the manifests and run `kfctl apply` again).

If you experience any issues running these scripts, see the [troubleshooting guidance](/docs/azure/troubleshooting-azure) for more information.

## Azure setup

### Login to Azure
    az login
### Initial cluster setup for new cluster

Create a resource group:

    az group create -n <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> -l <LOCATION>

Example variables:

- RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=KubeTest
- LOCATION=westus

Create a specifically defined cluster:

    az aks create -g <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> -n <NAME> -s <AGENT_SIZE> -c <AGENT_COUNT> -l <LOCATION> --generate-ssh-keys

Example variables: 

- NAME=KubeTestCluster
- AGENT_SIZE=Standard_D4s_v3
- AGENT_COUNT=2
- Use the same resource group and name from the previous step

**NOTE:  If you are using a GPU based AKS cluster (For example: AGENT_SIZE=Standard_NC6), you also need to [install the NVidia drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/gpu-cluster#install-nvidia-drivers) on the cluster nodes before you can use GPUs with Kubeflow.**

## Kubeflow installation
Run the following commands to set up and deploy Kubeflow.

1. Create user credentials. You only need to run this command once.

        az aks get-credentials -n <NAME> -g <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>

1. Download the kfctl {{% kf-latest-version %}} release from the
  [Kubeflow releases 
  page](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/releases/tag/{{% kf-latest-version %}}).

1. Unpack the tar ball

        tar -xvf kfctl_{{% kf-latest-version %}}_<platform>.tar.gz

1. Run the following commands to set up and deploy Kubeflow. The code below includes an optional command to add the binary kfctl to your path. If you donâ€™t add the binary to your path, you must use the full path to the kfctl binary each time you run it.

    ```
    # The following command is optional, to make kfctl binary easier to use.
    export PATH=$PATH:<path to where kfctl was unpacked>

    # Set KF_NAME to the name of your Kubeflow deployment. This also becomes the
    # name of the directory containing your configuration.
    # For example, your deployment name can be 'my-kubeflow' or 'kf-test'.
    export KF_NAME=<your choice of name for the Kubeflow deployment>

    # Set the path to the base directory where you want to store one or more 
    # Kubeflow deployments. For example, /opt/.
    # Then set the Kubeflow application directory for this deployment.
    export BASE_DIR=<path to a base directory>
    export KF_DIR=${BASE_DIR}/${KF_NAME}

    # Set the configuration file to use, such as the file specified below:
    export CONFIG_URI="{{% config-uri-k8s-istio %}}"

    # Generate and deploy Kubeflow:
    mkdir -p ${KF_DIR}
    cd ${KF_DIR}
    kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG_URI}
    ```

    * **${KF_NAME}** - The name of your Kubeflow deployment.
      If you want a custom deployment name, specify that name here.
      For example,  `my-kubeflow` or `kf-test`.
      The value of KF_NAME must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or
      '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
      The value of this variable cannot be greater than 25 characters. It must
      contain just a name, not a directory path.
      This value also becomes the name of the directory where your Kubeflow 
      configurations are stored, that is, the Kubeflow application directory. 

    * **${KF_DIR}** - The full path to your Kubeflow application directory.

1. Check the resources deployed correctly in namespace `kubeflow`

        kubectl get all -n kubeflow

1. Open Kubeflow Dashboard

The default installation does not create an external endpoint but you can use port-forwarding to visit your cluster. Run the following command and visit http://localhost:8080.

    kubectl port-forward svc/istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system 8080:80

To open the dashboard to a public IP address, you should first implement a solution to prevent unauthorized access. You can read more about Azure authentication options from [Access Control for Azure Deployment](/docs/azure/authentication).

## Additional information

You can find general information about Kubeflow configuration in the guide to [configuring Kubeflow with kfctl and kustomize](/docs/other-guides/kustomize/).
