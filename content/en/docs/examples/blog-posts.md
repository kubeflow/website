This article describes how you can tackle ML workflow operations with
Kubeflow Pipelines, and highlights some examples that you can try
yourself. The examples revolve around a TensorFlow ‘taxi fare tip prediction’
model, with data pulled from a public BigQuery dataset of Chicago taxi trips.

 A series of articles that walk you through the process of taking an existing
 real-world TensorFlow model and operationalizing the training, evaluation,
 deployment, and retraining of that model using Kubeflow Pipelines.
 [Part 1](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-and-deploy-a-kubeflow-machine-learning-pipeline-part-1-efea7a4b650f)
 (creating and deploying a pipeline), and
 [part 2](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-deploy-jupyter-notebooks-as-components-of-a-kubeflow-ml-pipeline-part-2-b1df77f4e5b3)
 (using Jupyter notebooks).
