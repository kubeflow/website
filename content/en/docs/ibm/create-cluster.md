This guide describes how to create a Kubernetes cluster with IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.

[IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service/) provides powerful tools and services to help deploy highly available containerized apps in Kubernetes clusters and to automate, isolate, secure, manage, and monitor your workloads across zones or regions.

You can use your existing clusters to install Kubeflow as far as it meets the minimum system requirement.

## Prerequisites

1. `IBMid`

    To get started, first go to [IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/Bdqgck) to create your `IBMid` if you do not have one.

2. Installing the IBM Cloud CLI

    Follow the instructions in this [Getting started with the IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started#overview) guide to install the IBM Cloud CLI.

3. Installing the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service plug-in with the command

    ```shell
    ibmcloud plugin install container-service
    ```

    Refer to this [link](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli) for more info on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service CLI.

4. Authenticating with IBM Cloud

    ```shell
    ibmcloud login
    ```

    Use your registered email and password for your `IBMid` to log in to IBM Cloud.

Follow these steps to create a cluster:

## Setting environment variables

Choose the region and the worker node provider for your cluster, and set the environment variables.

```shell
export KUBERNERTES_VERSION=1.16
export CLUSTER_ZONE=dal13
export WORKER_NODE_PROVIDER=classic
export CLUSTER_NAME=kubeflow
```

- `KUBERNETES_VERSION` specifies the Kubernetes version for the cluster. Run `ibmcloud ks versions` to see the supported Kubernetes versions. If this environment variable is not set, the cluster will be created with the default version set by IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. Refer to the [Minimum system requirements](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/overview/#minimum-system-requirements) and choose a Kubernetes version compatible with the Kubeflow release to be deployed.
- `CLUSTER_ZONE` identifies the regions or location where CLUSTER_NAME will be created. Run `ibmcloud ks locations` to list supported IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service locations. For example, choose `dal13` to create CLUSTER_NAME in the Dallas (US) data center.
- `WORKER_NODE_PROVIDER` specifies the kind of IBM Cloud infrastructure on which the Kubernetes worker nodes will be created. The `classic` type supports worker nodes with GPUs. There are other worker nodes providers including `vpc-classic` and `vpc-gen2` where zone names and worker flavors will be different. Please use `ibmcloud ks zones --provider ${WORKER_NODE_PROVIDER}` to list zone names if using other providers and set the `CLUSTER_ZONE` accordingly.
- `CLUSTER_NAME` must be lowercase and unique among any other Kubernetes
  clusters in the specified `${CLUSTER_ZONE}`.

**Notice**: If choosing other Kubernetes worker nodes providers than `classic`, refer to the IBM Cloud official document [Creating clusters](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-clusters) for detailed steps.

## Choosing a worker node flavor

The worker nodes flavor name varies from zones and providers. Run `ibmcloud ks flavors --zone ${CLUSTER_ZONE} --provider ${WORKER_NODE_PROVIDER}` to list available flavors. For example, following are some flavors supported in the `dal13` zone with `classic` worker node provider.

```text
$ ibmcloud ks flavors --zone dal13 --provider classic
OK
For more information about these flavors, see 'https://ibm.biz/flavors'

b3c.4x16                  4       16GB     1000Mbps        UBUNTU_18_64   virtual       25GB         100GB               classic
b3c.56x242                56      242GB    1000Mbps        UBUNTU_18_64   virtual       25GB         100GB               classic
b3c.8x32                  8       32GB     1000Mbps        UBUNTU_18_64   virtual       25GB         100GB               classic
...
```

Choose a flavor that will work for your applications. For the purpose of the Kubeflow deployment, the recommended configuration for a cluster is at least 8 vCPU cores with 16GB memory. Hence you can either choose the `b3c.8x32` flavor to create a one-worker-node cluster or choose the `b3c.4x16` flavor to create a two-worker-node cluster. Keep in mind that you can always scale the cluster by adding more worker nodes should your application scales up.

Now set the environment variable with the flavor you choose.

```shell
export WORKER_NODE_FLAVOR=b3c.4x16
```

## Creating a IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster

Run with the following command to create a cluster:

```shell
ibmcloud ks cluster create ${WORKER_NODE_PROVIDER} \
  --name ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
  --zone=${CLUSTER_ZONE} \
  --version=${KUBERNETES_VERSION} \
  --flavor ${WORKER_NODE_FLAVOR} \
  --workers=2
```

Replace the `workers` parameter above with the desired number of worker nodes.

Note: If you're starting in a fresh account with no public and private VLANs, they are created automatically for you when creating a Kubernetes cluster with worker nodes provider `classic` for the first time. If you already have VLANs configured in your account, retrieve them via `ibmcloud ks vlans --zone ${CLUSTER_ZONE}` and include the public and private VLAN ids (set in the `PUBLIC_VLAN_ID` and `PRIVATE_VLAN_ID` environment variables) in the command, for example:

```shell
ibmcloud ks cluster create ${WORKER_NODE_PROVIDER} \
  --name=$CLUSTER_NAME \
  --zone=$CLUSTER_ZONE \
  --version=${KUBERNETES_VERSION} \
  --flavor ${WORKER_NODE_FLAVOR} \
  --workers=2 \
  --private-vlan ${PRIVATE_VLAN_ID} \
  --public-vlan ${PUBLIC_VLAN_ID} 
```

Wait until the cluster is deployed and configured. It can take a while for the cluster to be ready. Run with following command to periodically check the state of your cluster. Your cluster is ready when the state is `normal`.

```shell
ibmcloud ks clusters --provider ${WORKER_NODE_PROVIDER} |grep ${CLUSTER_NAME}|awk '{print "Name:"$1"\tState:"$3}'
```

### Verifying the cluster

To use the created cluster, switch the Kubernetes context to point to the cluster with the command

```shell
ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME}
```

Make sure all worker nodes are up with the command below

```shell
kubectl get nodes
```

and make sure all the nodes are in `Ready` state.
