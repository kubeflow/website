## Understanding the Kubeflow deployment process

The deployment process is controlled by the following commands:

* **build** - (Optional) Creates configuration files defining the various
  resources in your deployment. You only need to run `kfctl build` if you want
  to edit the resources before running `kfctl apply`.
* **apply** - Creates or updates the resources.
* **delete** - Deletes the resources.

### App layout

Your Kubeflow application directory **${KF_DIR}** contains the following files and 
directories:

* **${CONFIG_FILE}** is a YAML file that defines configurations related to your 
  Kubeflow deployment.

  * This file is a copy of the GitHub-based configuration YAML file that
    you used when deploying Kubeflow. For example, {{% config-uri-ibm %}}.
  * When you run `kfctl apply` or `kfctl build`, kfctl creates
    a local version of the configuration file, `${CONFIG_FILE}`,
    which you can further customize if necessary.

* **kustomize** is a directory that contains the kustomize packages for Kubeflow applications.
    * The directory is created when you run `kfctl build` or `kfctl apply`.
    * You can customize the Kubernetes resources (modify the manifests and run `kfctl apply` again).

## Kubeflow installation

**Note**: kfctl is currently available for Linux and macOS users only. If you use Windows, you can install kfctl on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Refer to the official [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for setting up WSL.

Run the following commands to set up and deploy Kubeflow:

1. Download the latest kfctl {{% kf-latest-version %}} release from the
  [Kubeflow releases 
  page](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/releases/tag/{{% kf-latest-version %}}).
  
  **Note**: You're strongly recommended to install **kfctl v1.2** or above because kfctl v1.2 addresses several critical bugs that can break the Kubeflow deployment.

2. Extract the archived TAR file:

      ```shell
      tar -xvf kfctl_{{% kf-latest-version %}}_<platform>.tar.gz
      ```
3. Make kfctl binary easier to use (optional). If you donâ€™t add the binary to your path, you must use the full path to the kfctl binary each time you run it.

      ```shell
      export PATH=$PATH:<path to where kfctl was unpacked>
      ```
