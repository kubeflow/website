This guide describes how to use the kfctl binary to deploy Kubeflow on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS).

## Prerequisites

* Authenticate with IBM Cloud

  Log into IBM Cloud using the [IBM Cloud Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cli) as follows:

  ```shell
  ibmcloud login
  ```

* Create and access a Kubernetes cluster on IKS

  To deploy Kubeflow on IBM Cloud, you need a cluster running on IKS. If you don't have a cluster running, follow the [Create an IBM Cloud cluster](/docs/ibm/create-cluster) guide.

  Run the following command to switch the Kubernetes context and access the cluster:
  
  ```shell
  ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster <cluster_name>
  ```

  Replace `<cluster_name>` with your cluster name.

## IBM Cloud Block Storage Setup

**Note**: This section is only required when the worker nodes provider `WORKER_NODE_PROVIDER` is set to `classic`. For other infrastructures, IBM Cloud Block Storage is already set up as the cluster's default storage class.

When you use the `classic` worker node provider of an IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster, it uses [IBM Cloud File Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/file-storage) based on NFS as the default storage class. File Storage is designed to run RWX (read-write multiple nodes) workloads with proper security built around it. Therefore, File Storage [does not allow `fsGroup` securityContext](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security#container), which is needed for the [OIDC authentication service](https://github.com/arrikto/oidc-authservice) and Kubeflow Jupyter server.

[IBM Cloud Block Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/block-storage) provides a fast way to store data and
satisfy many of the Kubeflow persistent volume requirements such as `fsGroup` out of the box and optimized RWO (read-write single node) which is used on all Kubeflow's persistent volume claim. 

Therefore, you're recommended to set up [IBM Cloud Block Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_storage#add_block) as the default storage class so that you can
get the best experience from Kubeflow.

1. [Follow the instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install the Helm version 3 client on your local machine.

2. Add the IBM Cloud Helm chart repository to the cluster where you want to use the IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in.

    ```shell
    helm repo add iks-charts https://icr.io/helm/iks-charts
    helm repo update
    ```

3. Install the IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in. When you install the plug-in, pre-defined block storage classes are added to your cluster.

    ```shell
    helm install 1.7.0 iks-charts/ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin -n kube-system
    ```
    
    Example output:
    ```
    NAME: 1.7.0
    LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Aug 28 11:23:56 2020
    NAMESPACE: kube-system
    STATUS: deployed
    REVISION: 1
    NOTES:
    Thank you for installing: ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin.   Your release is named: 1.7.0
    ...
    ```

4. Verify that the installation was successful.

    ```shell
    kubectl get pod -n kube-system | grep block
    ```
    
5. Verify that the storage classes for Block Storage were added to your cluster.

    ```
    kubectl get storageclasses | grep block
    ```

6. Set the Block Storage as the default storage class.

    ```shell
    NEW_STORAGE_CLASS=ibmc-block-gold
    OLD_STORAGE_CLASS=$(kubectl get sc -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.metadata.annotations.storageclass\.kubernetes\.io\/is-default-class=="true")].metadata.name}')
    kubectl patch storageclass ${NEW_STORAGE_CLASS} -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'

    # List all the (default) storage classes
    kubectl get storageclass | grep "(default)"
    ```

    Example output:
    ```
    ibmc-block-gold (default)   ibm.io/ibmc-block   65s
    ```

    Make sure `ibmc-block-gold` is the only `(default)` storage class. If there are two or more rows in the above output, unset the previous `(default)` storage classes with the command below:
    ```shell
    kubectl patch storageclass ${OLD_STORAGE_CLASS} -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"false"}}}'
    ```

## Understanding the Kubeflow deployment process

The deployment process is controlled by the following commands:

* **build** - (Optional) Creates configuration files defining the various
  resources in your deployment. You only need to run `kfctl build` if you want
  to edit the resources before running `kfctl apply`.
* **apply** - Creates or updates the resources.
* **delete** - Deletes the resources.

### App layout

Your Kubeflow application directory **${KF_DIR}** contains the following files and 
directories:

* **${CONFIG_FILE}** is a YAML file that defines configurations related to your 
  Kubeflow deployment.

  * This file is a copy of the GitHub-based configuration YAML file that
    you used when deploying Kubeflow. For example, {{% config-uri-ibm %}}.
  * When you run `kfctl apply` or `kfctl build`, kfctl creates
    a local version of the configuration file, `${CONFIG_FILE}`,
    which you can further customize if necessary.

* **kustomize** is a directory that contains the kustomize packages for Kubeflow applications.
    * The directory is created when you run `kfctl build` or `kfctl apply`.
    * You can customize the Kubernetes resources (modify the manifests and run `kfctl apply` again).


## Kubeflow installation
Run the following commands to set up and deploy Kubeflow.

1. Download the kfctl {{% kf-latest-version %}} release from the
  [Kubeflow releases 
  page](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/releases/tag/{{% kf-latest-version %}}).

1. Unpack the tar ball
      ```
      tar -xvf kfctl_{{% kf-latest-version %}}_<platform>.tar.gz
      ```
1. Make kfctl binary easier to use (optional). If you donâ€™t add the binary to your path, you must use the full path to the kfctl binary each time you run it.
      ```
      export PATH=$PATH:<path to where kfctl was unpacked>
      ```
    
Choose either **single user** or **multi-tenant** section based on your usage.

### Single user
Run the following commands to set up and deploy Kubeflow for a single user without any authentication.

**Note**: By default, Kubeflow deployment on IBM Cloud uses the [Kubeflow pipeline with the Tekton backend](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfp-tekton#kubeflow-pipelines-with-tekton).
If you want to use the Kubeflow pipeline with the Argo backend, modify and uncomment the `argo` and `kfp-argo` applications
inside the `kfctl_ibm.yaml` below and remove the `kfp-tekton`, `tektoncd-install`, and `tektoncd-dashboard` applications. 

```shell
# Set KF_NAME to the name of your Kubeflow deployment. This also becomes the
# name of the directory containing your configuration.
# For example, your deployment name can be 'my-kubeflow' or 'kf-test'.
export KF_NAME=<your choice of name for the Kubeflow deployment>

# Set the path to the base directory where you want to store one or more 
# Kubeflow deployments. For example, /opt/.
# Then set the Kubeflow application directory for this deployment.
export BASE_DIR=<path to a base directory>
export KF_DIR=${BASE_DIR}/${KF_NAME}

# Set the configuration file to use, such as:
export CONFIG_FILE=kfctl_ibm.yaml
export CONFIG_URI="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/v1.2-branch/kfdef/kfctl_ibm.v1.2.0.yaml"

# Generate Kubeflow:
mkdir -p ${KF_DIR}
cd ${KF_DIR}
curl -L ${CONFIG_URI} > ${CONFIG_FILE}

# Deploy Kubeflow. You can customize the CONFIG_FILE if needed.
kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG_FILE}
```

* **${KF_NAME}** - The name of your Kubeflow deployment.
  If you want a custom deployment name, specify that name here.
  For example,  `my-kubeflow` or `kf-test`.
  The value of KF_NAME must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or
  '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
  The value of this variable cannot be greater than 25 characters. It must
  contain just a name, not a directory path.
  This value also becomes the name of the directory where your Kubeflow 
  configurations are stored, that is, the Kubeflow application directory. 

* **${KF_DIR}** - The full path to your Kubeflow application directory.

### Multi-user, auth-enabled

Run the following steps to deploy Kubeflow with [IBM Cloud AppID](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/app-id)
as an authentication provider. 

The scenario is a Kubeflow cluster admin configures Kubeflow as a web
application in AppID and manages user authentication with builtin identity
providers (Cloud Directory, SAML, social log-in with Google or Facebook etc.) or
custom providers.

1. Setup environment variables:
    ```shell
    export KF_NAME=<your choice of name for the Kubeflow deployment>

    # Set the path to the base directory where you want to store one or more 
    # Kubeflow deployments. For example, use `/opt/`.
    export BASE_DIR=<path to a base directory>

    # Then set the Kubeflow application directory for this deployment.
    export KF_DIR=${BASE_DIR}/${KF_NAME}
    ```

2. Setup configuration files:

    ```shell
    export CONFIG_FILE=kfctl_ibm_multi_user.yaml
    export CONFIG_URI="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/v1.2-branch/kfdef/kfctl_ibm_multi_user.v1.2.0.yaml"
    # Generate and deploy Kubeflow:
    mkdir -p ${KF_DIR}
    cd ${KF_DIR}
    curl -L ${CONFIG_URI} > ${CONFIG_FILE}
    ```
    
**Note**: By default, the IBM configuration is using the [Kubeflow pipeline with the Tekton backend](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfp-tekton#kubeflow-pipelines-with-tekton).
    If you want to use the Kubeflow pipeline with the Argo backend, modify and uncomment the `argo` and `kfp-argo-multi-user` applications
    inside the `kfctl_ibm_multi_user.yaml` and remove the `kfp-tekton-multi-user`, `tektoncd-install`, and `tektoncd-dashboard` applications. 
    
3. Deploy Kubeflow:

    ```shell
    kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG_FILE}
    ```

4. Wait until the deployment finishes successfully â€” for example, all pods should be in the `Running` state when you run the command:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pod -n kubeflow
    ```

5. Follow the [Creating an App ID service instance on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/app-id) guide for Kubeflow authentication. 
You can also learn [how to use App ID](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-getting-started) with different authentication methods.

6. Follow the [Registering your app](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-app#app-register) section of the App ID guide
to create an application with type _regularwebapp_ under the provisioned AppID
instance. Make sure the _scope_ contains _email_. Then retrieve the following
configuration parameters from your AppID:
    * `clientId`
    * `secret`
    * `oAuthServerUrl`
    
7. Register the Kubeflow OIDC redirect page. The Kubeflow OIDC redirect URL is `http://<kubeflow-FQDN>/login/oidc`. 
`<kubeflow-FQDN>` is the endpoint for accessing Kubeflow. By default, the `<kubeflow-FQDN>` on IBM Cloud is `<worker_node_external_ip>:31380`.

  Then, you need to place the Kubeflow OIDC redirect URL under **Manage Authentication** > **Authentication settings** > **Add web redirect URLs**.
  
<img src="/docs/images/ibm/appid-redirect-settings.png" 
  alt="APP ID Redirect Settings"
  class="mt-3 mb-3 border border-info rounded">

8. Create the namespace `istio-system` if it does not exist:

    ```shell
    kubectl create namespace istio-system
    ```

9. Create a secret prior to Kubeflow deployment by filling parameters from the
step 2 accordingly:

    ```shell
    kubectl create secret generic appid-application-configuration -n istio-system \
      --from-literal=clientId=<clientId> \
      --from-literal=secret=<secret> \
      --from-literal=oAuthServerUrl=<oAuthServerUrl> \
      --from-literal=oidcRedirectUrl=http://<kubeflow-FQDN>/login/oidc
    ```

    * `<oAuthServerUrl>` - fill in the value of oAuthServerUrl
    * `<clientId>` - fill in the value of clientId
    * `<secret>` - fill in the value of secret
    * `<kubeflow-FQDN>` - fill in the FQDN of Kubeflow, if you don't know yet, just give a dummy one like `localhost`. Then change it after you got one.
    
    **Note**: If any of the parameters changed after the initial Kubeflow deployment, you 
    will need to manually update these parameters in the secret `appid-application-configuration`
    then restart authservice by running the command `kubectl rollout restart sts authservice -n istio-system`.

### Verify mutli-user installation

Check the pod `authservice-0` is in running state in namespace `istio-system`:
```SHELL
kubectl get pod authservice-0 -n istio-system
```

## Next steps

Please follow the steps in [Exposing the Kubeflow dashboard with DNS and TLS termination](../authentication/#exposing-the-kubeflow-dashboard-with-dns-and-tls-termination) to secure the Kubeflow dashboard with HTTPS, then you will have the required DNS name as Kubeflow FQDN to enable the OIDC flow for AppID:

1. Follow the step [Adding redirect URIs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-managing-idp#add-redirect-uri)
to fill a URL for AppID to redirect to Kubeflow. The URL should look like `https://<kubeflow-FQDN>/login/oidc`.
2. Update the secret `appid-application-configuration` with the updated Kubeflow FQDN to replace `<kubeflow-FQDN>` in below command:
```SHELL
redirect_url=$(printf https://<kubeflow-FQDN>/login/oidc | base64 -w0) \
 kubectl patch secret appid-application-configuration -n istio-system \
 -p $(printf '{"data":{"oidcRedirectUrl": "%s"}}' $redirect_url)
```
3. restart the pod `authservice-0`:
```SHELL
kubectl rollout restart statefulset authservice -n istio-system
```

Then visit `https://<kubeflow-FQDN>/`, it should redirect you to AppID for authentication.
