This guide describes how to use the kfctl binary to deploy Kubeflow on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS).

## Prerequisites

* Authenticate with IBM Cloud

  Log into IBM Cloud using the [IBM Cloud Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cli) as follows:

  ```shell
  ibmcloud login
  ```

* Create and access a Kubernetes cluster on IKS

  To deploy Kubeflow on IBM Cloud, you need a cluster running on IKS. If you don't have a cluster running, follow the [Create an IBM Cloud cluster](/docs/ibm/create-cluster) guide.

  Run the following command to switch the Kubernetes context and access the cluster:
  
  ```shell
  ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster <cluster_name>
  ```

  Replace `<cluster_name>` with your cluster name.

## IBM Cloud Group ID Storage Setup

**Note**: This section is only required when the worker nodes provider `WORKER_NODE_PROVIDER` is set to `classic`. For other infrastructures, IBM Cloud Storage with Group ID support is already set up as the cluster's default storage class.

When you use the `classic` worker node provider of an IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster, it uses the regular [IBM Cloud File Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/file-storage) based on NFS as the default storage class. File Storage is designed to run RWX (read-write multiple nodes) workloads with proper security built around it. Therefore, File Storage [does not allow `fsGroup` securityContext](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security#container) unless it's configured with Group ID, which is needed for the [OIDC authentication service](https://github.com/arrikto/oidc-authservice) and Kubeflow Jupyter server.

Therefore, you're recommended to set up the default storage class with Group ID support so that you can get the best experience from Kubeflow.

1. Set the File Storage with Group ID support as the default storage class.

    ```shell
    NEW_STORAGE_CLASS=ibmc-file-gold-gid
    OLD_STORAGE_CLASS=$(kubectl get sc -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.metadata.annotations.storageclass\.kubernetes\.io\/is-default-class=="true")].metadata.name}')
    kubectl patch storageclass ${NEW_STORAGE_CLASS} -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'

    # List all the (default) storage classes
    kubectl get storageclass | grep "(default)"
    ```

    Example output:
    ```
    ibmc-file-gold-gid (default)   ibm.io/ibmc-file    Delete          Immediate           false                  14h
    ```

2. Make sure `ibmc-file-gold-gid` is the only `(default)` storage class. If there are two or more rows in the above output, unset the previous `(default)` storage classes with the command below:
    ```shell
    kubectl patch storageclass ${OLD_STORAGE_CLASS} -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"false"}}}'
    ```

## Installation 

Choose either **single user** or **multi-tenant** section based on your usage.

If you're experiencing issues during the installation because of conflicts on your Kubeflow deployment, you can [uninstall Kubeflow](/docs/ibm/deploy/uninstall-kubeflow) and install it again.

### Single user

Run the following commands to set up and deploy Kubeflow for a single user without any authentication.

**Note**: By default, Kubeflow deployment on IBM Cloud uses the [Kubeflow pipeline with the Tekton backend](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfp-tekton#kubeflow-pipelines-with-tekton).
If you want to use the Kubeflow pipeline with the Argo backend, modify and uncomment the `argo` and `kfp-argo` applications
inside the `kfctl_ibm.yaml` below and remove the `kfp-tekton`, `tektoncd-install`, and `tektoncd-dashboard` applications. 

```shell
# Set KF_NAME to the name of your Kubeflow deployment. This also becomes the
# name of the directory containing your configuration.
# For example, your deployment name can be 'my-kubeflow' or 'kf-test'.
export KF_NAME=<your choice of name for the Kubeflow deployment>

# Set the path to the base directory where you want to store one or more 
# Kubeflow deployments. For example, /opt/.
# Then set the Kubeflow application directory for this deployment.
export BASE_DIR=<path to a base directory>
export KF_DIR=${BASE_DIR}/${KF_NAME}

# Set the configuration file to use, such as:
export CONFIG_FILE=kfctl_ibm.yaml
export CONFIG_URI="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/v1.2-branch/kfdef/kfctl_ibm.v1.2.0.yaml"

# Generate Kubeflow:
mkdir -p ${KF_DIR}
cd ${KF_DIR}
curl -L ${CONFIG_URI} > ${CONFIG_FILE}

# Deploy Kubeflow. You can customize the CONFIG_FILE if needed.
kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG_FILE}
```

* **${KF_NAME}** - The name of your Kubeflow deployment.
  If you want a custom deployment name, specify that name here.
  For example,  `my-kubeflow` or `kf-test`.
  The value of KF_NAME must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or
  '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
  The value of this variable cannot be greater than 25 characters. It must
  contain just a name, not a directory path.
  This value also becomes the name of the directory where your Kubeflow 
  configurations are stored, that is, the Kubeflow application directory. 

* **${KF_DIR}** - The full path to your Kubeflow application directory.

The Kubeflow endpoint is exposed with [NodePort](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#nodeport) 31380. If you don't have any experience on Kubernetes, you can [expose the Kubeflow endpoint as a LoadBalancer](#expose-the-kubeflow-endpoint-as-loadbalancer) and access the **EXTERNAL_IP**.

### Multi-user, auth-enabled

Run the following steps to deploy Kubeflow with [IBM Cloud AppID](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/app-id)
as an authentication provider. 

The scenario is a Kubeflow cluster admin configures Kubeflow as a web
application in AppID and manages user authentication with builtin identity
providers (Cloud Directory, SAML, social log-in with Google or Facebook etc.) or
custom providers.

1. Set up environment variables:

    ```shell
    export KF_NAME=<your choice of name for the Kubeflow deployment>

    # Set the path to the base directory where you want to store one or more 
    # Kubeflow deployments. For example, use `/opt/`.
    export BASE_DIR=<path to a base directory>

    # Then set the Kubeflow application directory for this deployment.
    export KF_DIR=${BASE_DIR}/${KF_NAME}
    ```

2. Set up configuration files:

    ```shell
    export CONFIG_FILE=kfctl_ibm_multi_user.yaml
    export CONFIG_URI="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/v1.2-branch/kfdef/kfctl_ibm_multi_user.v1.2.0.yaml"
    # Generate and deploy Kubeflow:
    mkdir -p ${KF_DIR}
    cd ${KF_DIR}
    curl -L ${CONFIG_URI} > ${CONFIG_FILE}
    ```
    
**Note**: By default, the IBM configuration is using the [Kubeflow pipeline with the Tekton backend](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfp-tekton#kubeflow-pipelines-with-tekton).
    If you want to use the Kubeflow pipeline with the Argo backend, modify and uncomment the `argo` and `kfp-argo-multi-user` applications
    inside the `kfctl_ibm_multi_user.yaml` and remove the `kfp-tekton-multi-user`, `tektoncd-install`, and `tektoncd-dashboard` applications. 
    
3. Deploy Kubeflow:

    ```shell
    kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG_FILE}
    ```

4. Wait until the deployment finishes successfully â€” for example, all pods should be in the `Running` state when you run the command:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pod -n kubeflow
    ```

5. Follow the [Creating an App ID service instance on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/app-id) guide for Kubeflow authentication. 
You can also learn [how to use App ID](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-getting-started) with different authentication methods.

6. Follow the [Registering your app](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-app#app-register) section of the App ID guide
to create an application with type _regularwebapp_ under the provisioned AppID
instance. Make sure the _scope_ contains _email_. Then retrieve the following
configuration parameters from your AppID:
    * `clientId`
    * `secret`
    * `oAuthServerUrl`
    
7. Register the Kubeflow OIDC redirect page. The Kubeflow OIDC redirect URL is `http://<kubeflow-FQDN>/login/oidc`. 
`<kubeflow-FQDN>` is the endpoint for accessing Kubeflow. By default, the `<kubeflow-FQDN>` on IBM Cloud is `<worker_node_external_ip>:31380`. If you don't have any experience on Kubernetes, you can [expose the Kubeflow endpoint as a LoadBalancer](#expose-the-kubeflow-endpoint-as-loadbalancer) and use the **EXTERNAL_IP** for your `<kubeflow-FQDN>`.

  Then, you need to place the Kubeflow OIDC redirect URL under **Manage Authentication** > **Authentication settings** > **Add web redirect URLs**.
  
<img src="/docs/images/ibm/appid-redirect-settings.png" 
  alt="APP ID Redirect Settings"
  class="mt-3 mb-3 border border-info rounded">

8. Create the namespace `istio-system` if it does not exist:

    ```shell
    kubectl create namespace istio-system
    ```

9. Create a secret prior to Kubeflow deployment by filling parameters from the
step 2 accordingly:

    ```shell
    kubectl create secret generic appid-application-configuration -n istio-system \
      --from-literal=clientId=<clientId> \
      --from-literal=secret=<secret> \
      --from-literal=oAuthServerUrl=<oAuthServerUrl> \
      --from-literal=oidcRedirectUrl=http://<kubeflow-FQDN>/login/oidc
    ```

    * `<oAuthServerUrl>` - fill in the value of oAuthServerUrl
    * `<clientId>` - fill in the value of clientId
    * `<secret>` - fill in the value of secret
    * `<kubeflow-FQDN>` - fill in the FQDN of Kubeflow, if you don't know yet, just give a dummy one like `localhost`. Then change it after you got one.
    
    **Note**: If any of the parameters changed after the initial Kubeflow deployment, you 
    will need to manually update these parameters in the secret `appid-application-configuration`.
    Then, restart authservice by running the command `kubectl rollout restart sts authservice -n istio-system`.

### Verify mutli-user installation

Check the pod `authservice-0` is in running state in namespace `istio-system`:

```SHELL
kubectl get pod authservice-0 -n istio-system
```

## Next steps

To secure the Kubeflow dashboard with HTTPS, follow the steps in [Exposing the Kubeflow dashboard with DNS and TLS termination](../authentication/#exposing-the-kubeflow-dashboard-with-dns-and-tls-termination).
Then, you will have the required DNS name as Kubeflow FQDN to enable the OIDC flow for AppID:


1. Follow the step [Adding redirect URIs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-managing-idp#add-redirect-uri)
to fill a URL for AppID to redirect to Kubeflow. The URL should look like `https://<kubeflow-FQDN>/login/oidc`.

2. Update the secret `appid-application-configuration` with the updated Kubeflow FQDN to replace `<kubeflow-FQDN>` in below command:

```SHELL
redirect_url=$(printf https://<kubeflow-FQDN>/login/oidc | base64 -w0) \
 kubectl patch secret appid-application-configuration -n istio-system \
 -p $(printf '{"data":{"oidcRedirectUrl": "%s"}}' $redirect_url)
```
3. Restart the pod `authservice-0`:

```SHELL
kubectl rollout restart statefulset authservice -n istio-system
```

Then, visit `https://<kubeflow-FQDN>/`. The page should redirect you to AppID for authentication.

## Additional information

You can find general information about Kubeflow configuration in the guide to [configuring Kubeflow with kfctl and kustomize](/docs/methods/kfctl/kustomize/).

## Troubleshooting

### Expose the Kubeflow endpoint as a LoadBalancer

By default, the Kubeflow deployment on IBM Cloud only exposes the endpoint as [NodePort](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#nodeport) 31380. If you want to expose the endpoint as a [LoadBalancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer), run:

```shell
kubectl patch svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
```

Then, you can locate the LoadBalancer in the **EXTERNAL_IP** column when you run the following command:

```shell
kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system
```
