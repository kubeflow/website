This guide describes how to secure the Kubeflow authentication with HTTPS.
You can enable HTTPS for Kubeflow dashboard (and other web UIs) using the 
network load balancer (NLB) feature of the IBM Cloud Kubernetes service—choose 
the `classic` worker nodes provider in the 
[Setting environment variables](../../create-cluster#setting-environment-variables) 
section of the Create an IBM Cloud cluster guide.

**Note**: For details on NLB, go to the official
[Classic: About network load balancers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-loadbalancer-about) 
guide.

## Prerequisites

* Install and configure the 
[IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started).
* Install 
[multi-user, auth-enabled Kubeflow](../install-kubeflow/#multi-user-auth-enabled).

## Setting up an NLB

To set up an NLB for your Kuberetes cluster, follow the official 
[Classic: Setting up basic load balancing with an NLB 1.0](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-loadbalancer) 
guide. Notice that the setup process for a multi-zone cluster differs from that 
of a single-zone cluster. For details, go to 
[Setting up an NLB 1.0 in a multi-zone cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-loadbalancer#multi_zone_config).

1. To use the exisitng Istio ingress gateway (instead of creating a new 
service), you need to update the service type of `istio-ingressgateway` to 
`LoadBalancer` from `NodePort`. Run the following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl patch svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system -p '{"spec":{"type":"LoadBalancer"}}'
    ```

2. Verify that the NLB was created successfully. It might take a few minutes for 
the service to be created and an IP address to be made available. Run the 
command below and check if you can see the `LoadBalancer Ingress` IP address:

    ```shell
    kubectl describe service istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system | grep "LoadBalancer Ingress"
    ```

3. Store the external IP of the `istio-ingressgateway` service in an environment 
variable:

    ```shell
    export INGRESS_GATEWAY_IP=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
    ```

## Exposing the Kubeflow dashboard with DNS and TLS termination

The following instructions use the Kubeflow dashboard as an example. However, 
they apply to other web UI applications, since they all go through the Istio 
ingress gateway.

1. Store the Kubernetes cluster name in an environment variable by running the 
following command:

   ```shell
   export CLUSTER_NAME=<cluster_name>
   ```

2. Create a DNS domain and certificates for the IP of the service 
`istio-ingressgateway` in namespace `istio-system`:

    ```shell
    ibmcloud ks nlb-dns create classic --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME --ip $INGRESS_GATEWAY_IP --secret-namespace istio-system
    ```

3. List the registered domain names:

    ```shell
    ibmcloud ks nlb-dns ls --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME
    ```

4. Wait until the status of the certificate—the fourth field—of the new domain 
name becomes `created`. Then, save the value of the column `SSL Cert Secret 
Name` in environment variables by running these commands (replace 
`{SECRET_NAME}` with the secret's name as shown in the `SSL Cert Secret Name` 
column):

    ```shell
    export INGRESS_GATEWAY_SECRET={SECRET_NAME}
    ```

    **Note**: If there is more than one entry in the output, choose the one 
    that matches the IP address from `LoadBalancer Ingress` (step 2) of service 
    `istio-ingressgateway`.

5. Create a secret named `istio-ingressgateway-certs` for the 
`istio-ingressgateway` pods in namespace `istio-system`:

    ```shell
    kubectl get secret $INGRESS_GATEWAY_SECRET --namespace istio-system -o yaml > istio-ingressgateway-certs.yaml
    ```

6. Update the `istio-ingressgateway-certs.yaml` file by changing the value of 
`metadata.name` to `istio-ingressgateway-certs`. Then, run the following 
commands:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f istio-ingressgateway-certs.yaml -n istio-system
    kubectl rollout restart deploy istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system
    rm istio-ingressgateway-certs.yaml
    ```

7. Update the gateway `kubeflow-gateway` to expose port `443`. Create a resource 
file `kubeflow-gateway.yaml` as follows by replacing `<hostname>` with the value 
of the column `Hostname` in step 4:

    ```YAML
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: Gateway
    metadata:
    name: kubeflow-gateway
    namespace: kubeflow
    spec:
      selector:
        istio: ingressgateway
    servers:
    - hosts:
      - '<hostname>'
      port:
        name: https
        number: 443
        protocol: HTTPS
      tls:
        httpsRedirect: true # sends 301 redirect for http requests
        mode: SIMPLE
        privateKey: /etc/istio/ingressgateway-certs/tls.key
        serverCertificate: /etc/istio/ingressgateway-certs/tls.crt
    ```

8. Verify that the traffic is routed via HTTPS by using the value of 
above-mentioned `Hostname` in your browser. It should redirect traffic from an 
HTTP address to HTTPS address automatically.

**Note**: The certificates for the NLB DNS host secret expire every **90** days. 
The secret in the `istio-system` namespace is automatically renewed by IBM Cloud 
Kubernetes Service 37 days before it expires. After this secret is updated, you 
must manually copy it to the `istio-ingressgateway-certs` secret by repeating 
commands in step 6.

## Updating configuration of the authentication provider

When installing the multi-user, auth-enabled Kubeflow, Kubeflow uses an GitHub 
OAuth application as the authentication provider. After enabling Expose the 
Istio ingress gateway with DNS and TLS, you should update this GitHub OAuth app 
settings by replacing `{HOSTNAME}` with the hostname of created TLS certificate 
as follows:

* Homepage URL: `https://{HOSTNAME}/`
* Authorization callback URL: `https://{HOSTNAME}/dex/callback`
