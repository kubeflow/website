This guide describes how to use the kfctl binary to
deploy Kubeflow on IBM Cloud.

## Prerequisites

### Installing the IBM Cloud developer tools

> If you already have `ibmcloud` installed with the latest `ibmcloud ks` (Kubernetes Service) plug-in, you
> can skip these steps.

1.  Download and install the `ibmcloud` command line tool:
    https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started#overview

1.  Install the [Kubernetes Service plug-in](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli):
    ```
    ibmcloud plugin install container-service
    ```
1.  Authorize `ibmcloud`:
    ```
    ibmcloud login
    ```

### Setting environment variables

To simplify the command lines for this walkthrough, you need to define a few
environment variables.

1.  Set `CLUSTER_NAME` and `CLUSTER_ZONE` variables:

    ```
    export CLUSTER_NAME=kubeflow
    export CLUSTER_ZONE=dal13
    export WORKER_NODE_PROVIDER=classic
    ```

    - `CLUSTER_NAME` must be lowercase and unique among any other Kubernetes
      clusters in the specified CLUSTER_ZONE.
    - `CLUSTER_ZONE` identifies the regions or location where CLUSTER_NAME will be created. Run `ibmcloud ks locations` to list supported IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service locations. For example, choose `dal13` to create CLUSTER_NAME in the Dallas (US) data center.
    - `WORKER_NODE_PROVIDER` specifies the kind of IBM Cloud infrastructure on which the Kubernetes worker nodes will be created. 

**Notices**:
* It uses the worker nodes provider `classic` in this guide because it's the only one that supports worker nodes with GPUs.
* There are other worker nodes providers including `vpc-classic` and `vpc-gen2` where zone names and worker flavors will be different. Please use `ibmcloud ks zones --provider <provider-name>` to list zone names if using other providers and set the `CLUSTER_ZONE` accordingly.

### Creating a IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster

The worker nodes flavor name varies from zones and providers. Please run `ibmcloud ks flavors --zone $CLUSTER_ZONE --provider $WORKER_NODE_PROVIDER` to list available flavors.

To make sure the cluster is large enough to host all the Knative and Istio
components, the recommended configuration for a cluster is:

- Kubernetes version 1.16
- at least 4 vCPU cores with 16GB memory (e.g., uses the flavor `b3c.4x16` if choosing Ubuntu 18 or the flavor `b2c.4x16` if choosing Ubuntu 16)

1.  Create a Kubernetes cluster with the required specifications:

    ```
    ibmcloud ks cluster create $WORKER_NODE_PROVIDER \
      --flavor b3c.4x16 \
      --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
      --zone=$CLUSTER_ZONE \
      --workers=2
    ```

    If you're starting in a fresh account with no public and private VLANs, they
    are created automatically for you when creating a Kubernetes cluster with 
    worker nodes provider `classic` for the first time. If you already have VLANs configured in
    your account, get them via `ibmcloud ks vlans --zone $CLUSTER_ZONE` and
    include the public/private VLAN id in the `cluster create` command:

    ```
    ibmcloud ks cluster create $WORKER_NODE_PROVIDER \
      --machine-type=b2c.4x16 \
      --name=$CLUSTER_NAME \
      --zone=$CLUSTER_ZONE \
      --workers=3 \
      --private-vlan $PRIVATE_VLAN_ID \
      --public-vlan $PUBLIC_VLAN_ID 
    ```

1.  Wait until your Kubernetes cluster is deployed:

    ```
    ibmcloud ks clusters | grep $CLUSTER_NAME
    ```

    It can take a while for your cluster to be deployed. Repeat the above
    command until the state of your cluster is "normal".


1.  Point `kubectl` to the cluster:

    ```
    ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME
    ```

1.  Make sure all nodes are up:

    ```
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    Make sure all the nodes are in `Ready` state. You are now ready to install
    Istio into your cluster.

**Notice**: If choosing other Kubernetes worker nodes providers, please refer to the IBM Cloud official document [Creating clusters](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-clusters) for detailed steps.

## IBM Cloud Block Storage Setup

**Note**: This section is only required when the worker nodes provider `WORKER_NODE_PROVIDER` is set to `classic`. For other infrastructures, IBM Cloud Block Storage is already set up as the cluster's default storage class.

When using the `classic` worker nodes provider of IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster, by default, it uses [IBM Cloud File Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/file-storage) based on NFS as the default storage class. File Storage is designed to run RWX (read-write multiple nodes) workloads with proper security built around it. Therefore, File Storage [does not allow `fsGroup` securityContext](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security#container) which is needed for DEX and Kubeflow Jupyter Server.

[IBM Cloud Block Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/block-storage) provides a fast way to store data and
satisfy many of the Kubeflow persistent volume requirements such as `fsGroup` out of the box and optimized RWO (read-write single node) which is used on all Kubeflow's persistent volume claim. 

Therefore, we strongly recommend to set up [IBM Cloud Block Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_storage#add_block) as the default storage class so that you can
get the best experience from Kubeflow.

1. [Follow the instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install the Helm version 3 client on your local machine.

1. Add the IBM Cloud Helm chart repository to the cluster where you want to use the IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in.
    ```shell
    helm repo add iks-charts https://icr.io/helm/iks-charts
    helm repo update
    ```

1. Install the IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in. When you install the plug-in, pre-defined block storage classes are added to your cluster.
    ```shell
    helm install 1.6.0 iks-charts/ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin -n kube-system
    ```
    
    Example output:
    ```
    NAME: 1.6.0
    LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Feb 27 11:41:35 2020
    NAMESPACE: kube-system
    STATUS: deployed
    REVISION: 1
    NOTES:
    Thank you for installing: ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin.   Your release is named: 1.6.0
    ...
    ```

1. Verify that the installation was successful.
    ```shell
    kubectl get pod -n kube-system | grep block
    ```
    
1. Verify that the storage classes for Block Storage were added to your cluster.
    ```
    kubectl get storageclasses | grep block
    ```

1. Set the Block Storage as the default storageclass.
    ```shell
    kubectl patch storageclass ibmc-block-gold -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
    kubectl patch storageclass ibmc-file-bronze -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"false"}}}'
    
    # Check the default storageclass is block storage
    kubectl get storageclass | grep \(default\)
    ```
    
    Example output:
    ```
    ibmc-block-gold (default)   ibm.io/ibmc-block   65s
    ```

## Understanding the Kubeflow deployment process

The deployment process is controlled by the following commands:

* **build** - (Optional) Creates configuration files defining the various
  resources in your deployment. You only need to run `kfctl build` if you want
  to edit the resources before running `kfctl apply`.
* **apply** - Creates or updates the resources.
* **delete** - Deletes the resources.

### App layout

Your Kubeflow application directory **${KF_DIR}** contains the following files and 
directories:

* **${CONFIG_FILE}** is a YAML file that defines configurations related to your 
  Kubeflow deployment.

  * This file is a copy of the GitHub-based configuration YAML file that
    you used when deploying Kubeflow. For example, {{% config-uri-k8s-istio %}}.
  * When you run `kfctl apply` or `kfctl build`, kfctl creates
    a local version of the configuration file, `${CONFIG_FILE}`,
    which you can further customize if necessary.

* **kustomize** is a directory that contains the kustomize packages for Kubeflow applications.
    * The directory is created when you run `kfctl build` or `kfctl apply`.
    * You can customize the Kubernetes resources (modify the manifests and run `kfctl apply` again).


## Kubeflow installation
Run the following commands to set up and deploy Kubeflow.

1. Download the kfctl {{% kf-latest-version %}} release from the
  [Kubeflow releases 
  page](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/releases/tag/{{% kf-latest-version %}}).

1. Unpack the tar ball
      ```
      tar -xvf kfctl_{{% kf-latest-version %}}_<platform>.tar.gz
      ```
1. Make kfctl binary easier to use (optional). If you donâ€™t add the binary to your path, you must use the full path to the kfctl binary each time you run it.
      ```
      export PATH=$PATH:<path to where kfctl was unpacked>
      ```
    

Choose either **single user** or **multi-tenant** section based on your usage.

### Single user
Run the following commands to set up and deploy Kubeflow for a single user without any authentication.
```
# Set KF_NAME to the name of your Kubeflow deployment. This also becomes the
# name of the directory containing your configuration.
# For example, your deployment name can be 'my-kubeflow' or 'kf-test'.
export KF_NAME=<your choice of name for the Kubeflow deployment>

# Set the path to the base directory where you want to store one or more 
# Kubeflow deployments. For example, /opt/.
# Then set the Kubeflow application directory for this deployment.
export BASE_DIR=<path to a base directory>
export KF_DIR=${BASE_DIR}/${KF_NAME}

# Set the configuration file to use, such as the file specified below:
export CONFIG_URI="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/master/kfdef/kfctl_ibm.yaml"

# Generate and deploy Kubeflow:
mkdir -p ${KF_DIR}
cd ${KF_DIR}
kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG_URI}
```

* **${KF_NAME}** - The name of your Kubeflow deployment.
  If you want a custom deployment name, specify that name here.
  For example,  `my-kubeflow` or `kf-test`.
  The value of KF_NAME must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or
  '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
  The value of this variable cannot be greater than 25 characters. It must
  contain just a name, not a directory path.
  This value also becomes the name of the directory where your Kubeflow 
  configurations are stored, that is, the Kubeflow application directory. 

* **${KF_DIR}** - The full path to your Kubeflow application directory.

### Multi-user, auth-enabled
Run the following commands to deploy Kubeflow with GitHub OAuth application as authentication provider by dex. To support multi-users with authentication enabled, this guide uses [dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex) with [GitHub OAuth](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/). Before continue, refer to the guide [Creating an OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/) for steps to create an OAuth app on GitHub.com.

The scenario is a GitHub organization owner can authorize its organization members to access a deployed kubeflow. A member of this GitHub organization will be redirected to a page to grant access to the GitHub profile by Kubeflow.

1. Create a new OAuth app in GitHub. Use following setting to register the application:
    * Homepage URL: `http://localhost:8080/`
    * Authorization callback URL: `http://localhost:8080/dex/callback`
1. Once the application is registered, copy and save the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` for use later.
1. Setup environment variables:
    ```
    export KF_NAME=<your choice of name for the Kubeflow deployment>

    # Set the path to the base directory where you want to store one or more 
    # Kubeflow deployments. For example, /opt/.
    export BASE_DIR=<path to a base directory>

    # Then set the Kubeflow application directory for this deployment.
    export KF_DIR=${BASE_DIR}/${KF_NAME}
    ```
1. Setup configuration files:
    ```
    export CONFIG_URI="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/master/kfdef/kfctl_ibm_dex.yaml"
    # Generate and deploy Kubeflow:
    mkdir -p ${KF_DIR}
    cd ${KF_DIR}
    kfctl build -V -f ${CONFIG_URI}
    ```
1. Deploy Kubeflow:
    ```
    kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG_URI}
    ```
1. Wait until the deployment finishes successfully. e.g., all pods are in `Running` state when running `kubectl get pod -n kubeflow`.
1. Update the configmap `dex` in namespace `auth` with credentials from the first step.
    - Get current resource file of current configmap `dex`:
    `kubectl get configmap dex -n auth -o yaml > dex-cm.yaml`
    The `dex-cm.yaml` file looks like following:
    ```YAML
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: dex
      namespace: auth
    data:
      config.yaml: |
        issuer: http://dex.auth.svc.cluster.local:5556/dex
        storage:
          type: kubernetes
          config:
            inCluster: true
        web:
          http: 0.0.0.0:5556
        logger:
          level: "debug"
          format: text
        connectors:
          - type: github
            # Required field for connector id.
            id: github
            # Required field for connector name.
            name: GitHub
            config:
              # Fill in client ID, client Secret as string literal.
              clientID:
              clientSecret: 
              redirectURI: http://dex.auth.svc.cluster.local:5556/dex/callback
              # Optional organizations and teams, communicated through the "groups" scope.
              #
              # NOTE: This is an EXPERIMENTAL config option and will likely change.
              #
              orgs:
              # Fill in your GitHub organization name
              - name:
              # Required ONLY for GitHub Enterprise. Leave it empty when using github.com.
              # This is the Hostname of the GitHub Enterprise account listed on the
              # management console. Ensure this domain is routable on your network.
              hostName:
              # Flag which indicates that all user groups and teams should be loaded.
              loadAllGroups: false
              # flag which will switch from using the internal GitHub id to the users handle (@mention) as the user id.
              # It is possible for a user to change their own user name but it is very rare for them to do so
              useLoginAsID: false
        staticClients:
        - id: kubeflow-oidc-authservice
          redirectURIs: ["/login/oidc"]
          name: 'Dex Login Application'
          secret: pUCnCOY80SnXgjibTYM0ZWNzY3xreNGQok
    ```
    - Replace `clientID` and `clientSecret` in the `config.yaml` field with the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` created above for the GitHub OAuth application. Add your organization name to the `orgs` field, e.g.
    ```YAML
    orgs:
    - name: kubeflow-test
    ```
    Save the `dex-cm.yaml` file.
    - Update this change to the Kubernetes cluster:
    ```
    kubectl apply -f dex-cm.yaml -n auth

    # Remove this file with sensitive information.
    rm dex-cm.yaml
    ```
    
1. Apply configuration changes:
    ```
    kubectl rollout restart deploy/dex -n auth
    ```

## Verify installation

1. Check the resources deployed correctly in namespace `kubeflow`

     ```
     kubectl get all -n kubeflow
     ```

1. Open Kubeflow Dashboard. The default installation does not create an external endpoint but you can use port-forwarding to visit your cluster. Run the following command and visit http://localhost:8080.

     ```
     kubectl port-forward svc/istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system 8080:80
     ```

In case you want to expose the Kubeflow Dashboard over an external IP, you can change the type of the ingress gateway. To do that, you can edit the service:

     kubectl edit -n istio-system svc/istio-ingressgateway

From that file, replace `type: NodePort` with `type: LoadBalancer` and save.

While the change is being applied, you can watch the service until below command prints a value under the `EXTERNAL-IP` column:

     kubectl get -w -n istio-system svc/istio-ingressgateway

The external IP should be accessible by visiting http://<EXTERNAL-IP>. Note that above installation instructions do not create any protection for the external endpoint so it will be accessible to anyone without any authentication. 

## Additional information

You can find general information about Kubeflow configuration in the guide to [configuring Kubeflow with kfctl and kustomize](/docs/other-guides/kustomize/).
