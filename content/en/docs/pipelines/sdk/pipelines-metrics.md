This page shows you how to export metrics from a Kubeflow Pipelines component. 
For details about how to build a component, see the guide to 
[building your own component](/docs/pipelines/sdk/build-component/).
 
## Overview of metrics

Kubeflow Pipelines supports the export of scalar metrics. You can write a list
of metrics to a local file to describe the performance of the model. The
pipeline agent uploads the local file as your run-time metrics. You can view the
uploaded metrics as a visualization in the **Runs** page for a particular
experiment in the Kubeflow Pipelines UI.
 
## Export the metrics file

To enable metrics, your program must write out a file named 
`/mlpipeline-metrics.json`. For example:

```Python
  accuracy = accuracy_score(df['target'], df['predicted'])
  metrics = {
    'metrics': [{
      'name': 'accuracy-score', # The name of the metric. Visualized as the column name in the runs table.
      'numberValue':  accuracy, # The value of the metric. Must be a numeric value.
      'format': "PERCENTAGE",   # The optional format of the metric. Supported values are "RAW" (displayed in raw format) and "PERCENTAGE" (displayed in percentage format).
    }]
  }
  with file_io.FileIO('/mlpipeline-metrics.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(metrics, f)
```

See the 
[full example](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/components/local/confusion_matrix/src/confusion_matrix.py).

The metrics file has the following requirements:

* The file path must be `/mlpipeline-metrics.json`.
* `name` must follow the pattern `^[a-zA-Z]([-_a-zA-Z0-9]{0,62}[a-zA-Z0-9])?$`.

    For Kubeflow Pipelines version 0.5.1 or earlier, name must match the following pattern `^[a-z]([-a-z0-9]{0,62}[a-z0-9])?$`
* `numberValue` must be a numeric value.
* `format` can only be `PERCENTAGE`, `RAW`, or not set.

## View the metrics

To see a visualization of the metrics:

1. Open the **Experiments** page in the Kubeflow Pipelines UI.
1. Click one of your experiments. The **Runs** page opens showing the top two 
  metrics, where *top* is determined by prevalence (that is, the metrics with 
  the highest count) and then by metric name. 
  The metrics appear as columns for each run.
  
The following example shows the **accuracy-score** and 
**roc-auc-score** metrics for two runs within an experiment:

## Next step

Visualize the output of your component by [writing out metadata for an output 
viewer](/docs/pipelines/metrics/output-viewer/).
