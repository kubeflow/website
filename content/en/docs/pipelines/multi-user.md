Multi-user isolation for Kubeflow Pipelines is an integration to [Kubeflow multi-user isolation](/docs/components/multi-tenancy/).

Please refer to [Getting Started with Multi-user isolation](/docs/components/multi-tenancy/getting-started/)
for the common Kubeflow multi-user operations including the following:

* [Grant user minimal Kubernetes cluster access](/docs/components/multi-tenancy/getting-started/#pre-requisites-grant-user-minimal-kubernetes-cluster-access)
* [Managing contributors through the Kubeflow UI](/docs/components/multi-tenancy/getting-started/#managing-contributors-through-the-kubeflow-ui)
<!-- TODO(Bobgy): document Grant user GCP permissions in above doc -->

Note, Kubeflow Pipelines multi-user isolation is only supported in
[the full Kubeflow deployment](/docs/pipelines/installation/overview/#full-kubeflow-deployment)
starting from Kubeflow v1.1 and **only** in the following platforms:

* Google Cloud
* Amazon Web Services
* IBM Cloud

Also be aware that the isolation support in Kubeflow doesn’t provide any hard
security guarantees against malicious attempts by users to infiltrate other
user’s profiles.
 
## How are KFP resources separated?

when you visit UI, namespace selector determines which resources are shown.
except pipelines

when using sdk, 
* <!-- this should be in GCP pipelines - auth doc --> how to authenticate to the public endpoint
* add namespace resource reference/namespace argument to api endpoints.

All features are supported.

Mention which resources are separated:
* experiments
* runs
* jobs
* external artifacts e.g. links in mlpipeline-ui-metadata.json
* tensorboard

Others not separated mentioned below

## What are current limitations?

* pipelines
* mlmd
* minio artifact storage
* in-cluster auth based on service account token or istio mTLS
