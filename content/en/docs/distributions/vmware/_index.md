VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid
VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid provides organizations with a consistent, upstream-compatible, regional Kubernetes substrate that is ready for end-user workloads and ecosystem integrations. You can deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Grid across software-defined datacenters (SDDC) and public cloud environments, including vSphere, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon EC2.

This paper [Running Kubeflow on AI-Ready Enterprise Platform on VMware vSphere 7 with VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid](https://core.vmware.com/aiml-solutions) provides a general design and deployment guidance for running Kubeflow on VMware vSphere® 7 with VMware Tanzu® Kubernetes Grid™ with GPU access empowered by NVIDIA Artificial Intelligence Enterprise (NVAIE). It also validated the core component functions to demonstrate that Kubeflow enables repeatable and reproducible machine learning workflows that can be shared between different teams such as data scientists, machine learning engineers, and DevOps.
