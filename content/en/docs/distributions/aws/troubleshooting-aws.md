### ALB Fails to Provision

If you see your istio-ingress ADDRESS is empty after more than a few mins, it's possible that something is misconfigured in your ALB ingress controller.
```shell
kubectl get ingress -n istio-system
NAME            HOSTS   ADDRESS   PORTS   AGE
istio-ingress   *                 80      3min
```

Check the AWS ALB Ingress Controller logs.
```shell
kubectl -n kubeflow logs $(kubectl get pods -n kubeflow --selector=app=aws-alb-ingress-controller --output=jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) 
```

If you see this error in the ingress logs, see the note below.
```
E1024 09:02:59.934318       1 :0] kubebuilder/controller "msg"="Reconciler error" "error"="failed to build LoadBalancer configuration due to retrieval of subnets failed to resolve 2 qualified subnets. Subnets must contain the kubernetes.io/cluster/\u003ccluster name\u003e tag with a value of shared or owned and the kubernetes.io/role/elb tag signifying it should be used for ALBs Additionally, there must be at least 2 subnets with unique availability zones as required by ALBs. Either tag subnets to meet this requirement or use the subnets annotation on the ingress resource to explicitly call out what subnets to use for ALB creation. The subnets that did resolve were []"  "controller"="alb-ingress-controller" "request"={"Namespace":"istio-system","Name":"istio-ingress"}
```

If you see this error, you likely didn't install from a directory named `cluster_name` during setup. Please check `kubectl get configmaps aws-alb-ingress-controller-config -n kubeflow -o yaml` and make any needed change.

Another reason could be that your subnets are not tagged so that Kubernetes knows which subnets to use for external load balancers. To fix this, ensure your cluster's public subnets are tagged with the **Key**: ```kubernetes.io/role/elb``` and **Value**: ```1```. See the [Amazon EKS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/alb-ingress.html) for further details.

### EKS Cluster Creation Failure

There are a few problems that could lead to cluster creation failure. If you see errors when creating your cluster using `eksctl`, open the AWS CloudFormation console and check the stack(s) related to your cluster. To recover from failure, you need to follow the guidance from the `eksctl` output logs. Once you understand the cause of your failure, you can remediate and create a fresh cluster.

Common issues:

1. Resource limits met in the AWS Region where you are creating the cluster (e.g. no available VPC)
1. Invalid command arguments

`eksctl` will attempt to rollback changes in the event of a failure. See below for an example failed cluster creation where a resource limit was met.

```shell
+ eksctl create cluster --config-file=/tmp/cluster_config.yaml
[ℹ]  using region us-west-2
[ℹ]  subnets for us-west-2b - public:192.168.0.0/19 private:192.168.96.0/19

### InvalidParameterException in UpdateCluster

```shell
+ logging_components='"api","audit","authenticator","controllerManager","scheduler"'
++ aws eks update-cluster-config --name benchmark-0402222-sunday-satur --region us-west-2 --logging '{"clusterLogging":[{"types":["api","audit","authenticator","controllerManager","scheduler"],"enabled":true}]}'

An error occurred (InvalidParameterException) when calling the UpdateClusterConfig operation: No changes needed for the logging config provided
```

The Amazon EKS `UpdateCluster` API operation will fail if you have invalid parameters. For example, if you already enabled logs in your EKS cluster, and you choose to create Kubeflow on existing cluster and also enable logs, you will get this error.

### FSx Mount Failure

```shell
Mounting command: mount
Mounting arguments: -t lustre fs-0xxxxx2a216cf.us-west-2.amazonaws.com@tcp:/fsx /var/lib/kubelet/pods/224c2c96-5a91-11e9-b7e6-0a2a42c99f84/volumes/kubernetes.io~csi/fsx-static/mount
Output: mount.lustre: Can't parse NID 'fs-0xxxxx2a216cf.us-west-2.amazonaws.com@tcp:/fsx'

This mount helper should only be invoked via the mount (8) command,
e.g. mount -t lustre dev dir

usage: mount.lustre [-fhnvV] [-o <mntopt>] <device> <mountpt>
  <device>: the disk device, or for a client:
    <mgsnid>[:<altmgsnid>...]:/<filesystem>[/<subdir>]
  <filesystem>: name of the Lustre filesystem (e.g. lustre1)
  <mountpt>: filesystem mountpoint (e.g. /mnt/lustre)
  -f|--fake: fake mount (updates /etc/mtab)
```

The Amazon FSx `dnsName` is incorrect, you can delete your Pod using this PersistentVolumeClaim. The next step is to delete the PVC and PersistentVolume. Finally, correct your configuration and recreate the PV and PVC.

```shell
kubectl delete pod ${pod_using_pvc}
ks delete default -c ${COMPONENT}
ks param set ${COMPONENT} dnsName fs-0xxxxx2a216cf.fsx.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
ks apply default -c ${COMPONENT}
```

### Amazon RDS Connectivity Issues

If you run into CloudFormation deployment errors, you can use [troubleshooting guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html) to find a resolution.

If you have connectivity issues with Amazon RDS, launch a `mysql-client` container and try connecting to your RDS endpoint. This will let you know if you have network connectivity with the database and also if the database was created and is configured properly.

```
# Remember to change your RDS endpoint, DB username and DB Password
$ kubectl run -it --rm --image=mysql:5.7 --restart=Never mysql-client -- mysql -h <YOUR RDS ENDPOINT> -u admin -pKubefl0w                                                              
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
