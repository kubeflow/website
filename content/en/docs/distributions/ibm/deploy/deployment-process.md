## Understanding the Kubeflow deployment process

The deployment process is controlled by the following commands:

* **build** - (Optional) Creates configuration files defining the various
  resources in your deployment. You only need to run `kfctl build` if you want
  to edit the resources before running `kfctl apply`.
* **apply** - Creates or updates the resources.
* **delete** - Deletes the resources.

### App layout

Your Kubeflow application directory **${KF_DIR}** contains the following files and 
directories:

* **${CONFIG_FILE}** is a YAML file that defines configurations related to your 
  Kubeflow deployment.

  * This file is a copy of the GitHub-based configuration YAML file that
    you used when deploying Kubeflow. For example, {{% config-uri-ibm %}}.
  * When you run `kfctl apply` or `kfctl build`, kfctl creates
    a local version of the configuration file, `${CONFIG_FILE}`,
    which you can further customize if necessary.

* **kustomize** is a directory that contains the kustomize packages for Kubeflow applications.
    * The directory is created when you run `kfctl build` or `kfctl apply`.
    * You can customize the Kubernetes resources (modify the manifests and run `kfctl apply` again).

## Kubeflow installation

As of Kubeflow 1.3, the official installation documentation uses a combination of `kustomize` and `kubectl` to install Kubeflow. Using `kfdef` and `kfctl` will also continue to be a way to install Kubeflow. 

### Install kfctl

**Note**: kfctl is currently available for Linux and macOS users only. If you use Windows, you can install kfctl on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Refer to the official [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for setting up WSL.

Run the following commands to set up and deploy Kubeflow:

1. Download the latest kfctl {{% kf-latest-version %}} release from the
  [Kubeflow releases 
  page](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/releases/tag/v1.2.0).
  
  **Note**: You're strongly recommended to install **kfctl v1.2** or above because kfctl v1.2 addresses several critical bugs that can break the Kubeflow deployment.

2. Extract the archived TAR file:

      ```shell
      tar -xvf kfctl_v1.2.0-0-gbc038f9_<platform>.tar.gz
      ```
3. Make kfctl binary easier to use (optional). If you donâ€™t add the binary to your path, you must use the full path to the kfctl binary each time you run it.

      ```shell
      export PATH=$PATH:<path to where kfctl was unpacked>
      ```

### Install kubectl and kustomize

* [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) 
* [Download kustomize 3.2.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/v3.2.0)

To use the `kustomize` binary, you need to make it executable and move it to your path.

To add `kustomize` to your global path, run the following commands:

```bash
wget https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/download/v3.2.0/<distribution>
chmod +x <distribution>
mv <distribution> /usr/local/bin/kustomize
```

Your machine might already have `kustomize` installed. If you want to temporarily add this version of `kustomize` to your path, run the following commands:

```bash
wget https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/download/v3.2.0/<distribution>
chmod +x <distribution>
mv <distribution> /some/path/kustomize
# /some/path should not already be in path. 
export PATH=/some/path:$PATH
# order is important here. $PATH needs to be the last thing. We are trying to put our kustomize before the kustomize installtion in system.
```
