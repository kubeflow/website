   IBM manifests repository: https://github.com/IBM/manifests.git
   ```shell

   ```

   ```shell
   kubectl get profile
   ```

3. Delete all Kubeflow Profiles manually:
   ```shell
   kubectl delete profile --all
   ```
   Use the following command to check all namespaces for Kubeflow Profiles
   are removed properly:
   ```
   kubectl get ns
   ```
   Make sure no namespace is in the `Terminating` state.

   ```

   For multi-user deployment:
