## Introduction

[Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/anthos) is a hybrid and multi-cloud 
application platform developed and supported by Google. Anthos is built on
open source technologies, including Kubernetes, Istio, and Knative.

Using Anthos, you can create a consistent setup across your on-premises and 
cloud environments, helping you to automate policy and security at scale.

We are collecting interest for Kubeflow on GKE On Prem. You can subscribe
to the GitHub issue [kubeflow/gcp-blueprints#138](https://github.com/kubeflow/gcp-blueprints/issues/138).

## Next steps

While waiting for a response from the support team, you may like to [deploy
Kubeflow on GKE](/docs/gke/deploy/).
