This page explains how to delete your Kubeflow cluster or management cluster on
Google Cloud.

## Before you start

This guide assumes the following settings:

* For Management cluster: The `${MGMT_PROJECT}`, `${MGMT_DIR}` and `${MGMT_NAME}` environment variables
  are the same as in [Deploy Management cluster](/docs/distributions/gke/deploy/management-setup#configure-environment-variables).

* For Kubeflow cluster: The `${KF_PROJECT}`, `${KF_NAME}` and `${MGMTCTXT}` environment variables
  are the same as in [Deploy Kubeflow cluster](../deploy-cli#environment-variables).
  
* The `${KF_DIR}` environment variable contains the path to
  your Kubeflow application directory, which holds your Kubeflow configuration 
  files. For example, `/opt/gcp-blueprints/kubeflow/`.

## Deleting your Kubeflow cluster

1. To delete the applications running in the Kubeflow namespace, remove that namespace:

    ```bash
    kubectl delete namespace kubeflow
    ```

1. To delete the cluster and all Google Cloud resources, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    cd "${KF_DIR}"
    make delete
    ```

    **Warning**: this will delete the persistent disks storing metadata. If you want to preserve the disks, don't run this command;
    instead selectively delete only those resources you want to delete.

## Clean up your management cluster

The following instructions introduce how to clean up all resources created when
installing management cluster in management project, and when using management cluster to manage Google Cloud resources in managed Kubeflow projects.

### Delete or keep managed Google Cloud resources

There are Google Cloud resources managed by Config Connector in the
management cluster after you deploy Kubeflow clusters with this management
cluster.

To delete all the managed Google Cloud resources, delete the managed project namespace:

```bash
kubectl config use-context "${MGMTCTXT}"
kubectl delete namespace --wait "${KF_PROJECT}"
```

To keep all the managed Google Cloud resources, you can [delete the management
cluster](#delete-management-cluster) directly.

If you need fine-grained control, refer to
[Config Connector: Keeping resources after deletion](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/how-to/managing-deleting-resources#keeping_resources_after_deletion)
for more details.

After deleting Config Connector resources for a managed project, you can revoke IAM permission
that let the management cluster manage the project:

```bash
gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding "${KF_PROJECT}" \
    "--member=serviceAccount:${MGMT_NAME}-cnrm-system@${MGMT_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role=roles/owner
```

### Delete management cluster

To delete the Google service account and the management cluster:

```bash
cd "${MGMT_DIR}"
make delete-cluster
```

Starting from Kubeflow v1.5, Google Cloud distribution has switched to Config Controller for Google-managed Management cluster. You can learn more detail by reading [Delete your Config Controller](https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/how-to/config-controller-setup#delete_your).

Note, after deleting the management cluster, all the managed Google Cloud
resources will be kept. You will be responsible for managing them by yourself.
If you want to delete the managed Google Cloud resources, make sure to delete resources in the `${KF_PROJECT}` namespace in the management cluster first.
You can learn more about the `${KF_PROJECT}` namespace in `gcp-blueprints/kubeflow/kcc` folder.

You can create a management cluster to manage them again if you apply the same
Config Connector resources. Refer to [Managing and deleting resources - Acquiring an existing resource](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/how-to/managing-deleting-resources#acquiring_an_existing_resource).
