This guide describes how to use the kfctl binary to
deploy Kubeflow on Azure.

## Prerequisites

- Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-on-linux)
- Install and configure the [Azure Command Line Interface (Az)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
  - Log in with ```az login```
- Install Docker
  - For Windows and WSL: [Guide](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/)
  - For other OS: [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/)

You do not need to have an existing Azure Resource Group or Cluster for AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service). You can create a cluster in the deployment process.

## Understanding the deployment process

The deployment process is controlled by the following commands:

* **build** - (Optional) Creates configuration files defining the various
  resources in your deployment. You only need to run `kfctl build` if you want
  to edit the resources before running `kfctl apply`.
* **apply** - Creates or updates the resources.
* **delete** - Deletes the resources.

### App layout

Your Kubeflow application directory **${KF_DIR}** contains the following files and
directories:

* **${CONFIG_FILE}** is a YAML file that defines configurations related to your
  Kubeflow deployment.

  * This file is a copy of the GitHub-based configuration YAML file that
    you used when deploying Kubeflow. For example, {{% azure/config-uri-azure %}}.
  * When you run `kfctl apply` or `kfctl build`, kfctl creates
    a local version of the configuration file, `${CONFIG_FILE}`,
    which you can further customize if necessary.

* **kustomize** is a directory that contains the kustomize packages for Kubeflow applications.
  * The directory is created when you run `kfctl build` or `kfctl apply`.
  * You can customize the Kubernetes resources (modify the manifests and run `kfctl apply` again).

If you experience any issues running these scripts, see the [troubleshooting guidance](/docs/azure/troubleshooting-azure) for more information.

## Azure setup

### To log into Azure from the command line interface, run the following commands

  ```
  az login
  az account set --subscription <NAME OR ID OF SUBSCRIPTION>
  ```

### Initial cluster setup for new cluster

Create a resource group:

  ```
  az group create -n <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> -l <LOCATION>
  ```

Example variables:

- `RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=KubeTest`
- `LOCATION=westus`

Create a specifically defined cluster:
  
  ```
  az aks create -g <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> -n <NAME> -s <AGENT_SIZE> -c <AGENT_COUNT> -l <LOCATION> --generate-ssh-keys
  ```

Example variables:

- `NAME=KubeTestCluster`
- `AGENT_SIZE=Standard_D4s_v3`
- `AGENT_COUNT=2`
- `RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=KubeTest`

**NOTE**:  If you are using a GPU based AKS cluster (For example: AGENT_SIZE=Standard_NC6), you also need to [install the NVidia drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/gpu-cluster#install-nvidia-drivers) on the cluster nodes before you can use GPUs with Kubeflow.

## Kubeflow installation

**Important**: To deploy Kubeflow on Azure with multi-user authentication and namespace separation, use the instructions for [Authentication using OICD in Azure](/docs/azure/authentication-oidc). The instructions in this guide apply only to a single-user Kubeflow deployment. Such a deployment cannot be upgraded to a multi-user deployment at this time.

**Note**: kfctl is currently available for Linux and macOS users only. If you use Windows, you can install kfctl on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Refer to the official [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for setting up WSL.

Run the following commands to set up and deploy Kubeflow.

1. Create user credentials. You only need to run this command once.

    ```
    az aks get-credentials -n <NAME> -g <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>
    ```

1. Download the kfctl {{% kf-latest-version %}} release from the
  [Kubeflow releases
  page](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/releases/tag/{{% kf-latest-version %}}).

1. Unpack the tar ball:

    ```
    tar -xvf kfctl_{{% kf-latest-version %}}_<platform>.tar.gz
    ```

1. Run the following commands to set up and deploy Kubeflow. The code below includes an optional command to add the
   binary kfctl to your path. If you donâ€™t add the binary to your path, you must use the full path to the kfctl binary each time you run it.

    ```
    # The following command is optional. It adds the kfctl binary to your path.
    # If you don't add kfctl to your path, you must use the full path
    # each time you run kfctl.
    # Use only alphanumeric characters or - in the directory name.
    export PATH=$PATH:"<path-to-kfctl>"

    # Set KF_NAME to the name of your Kubeflow deployment. You also use this
    # value as directory name when creating your configuration directory.
    # For example, your deployment name can be 'my-kubeflow' or 'kf-test'.
    export KF_NAME=<your choice of name for the Kubeflow deployment>

    # Set the path to the base directory where you want to store one or more 
    # Kubeflow deployments. For example, /opt/.
    # Then set the Kubeflow application directory for this deployment.
    export BASE_DIR=<path to a base directory>
    export KF_DIR=${BASE_DIR}/${KF_NAME}

    # Set the configuration file to use when deploying Kubeflow.
    # The following configuration installs Istio by default. Comment out 
    # the Istio components in the config file to skip Istio installation. 
    # See https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/3663
    export CONFIG_URI="{{% config-uri-k8s-istio %}}"
    
    mkdir -p ${KF_DIR}
    cd ${KF_DIR}
    kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG_URI}

    ```

    * **${KF_NAME}** - The name of your Kubeflow deployment.
      If you want a custom deployment name, specify that name here.
      For example,  `my-kubeflow` or `kf-test`.
      The value of KF_NAME must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or
      '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
      The value of this variable cannot be greater than 25 characters. It must
      contain just a name, not a directory path.
      You also use this value as directory name when creating the directory where 
      your Kubeflow  configurations are stored, that is, the Kubeflow application 
      directory. 

    * **${KF_DIR}** - The full path to your Kubeflow application directory.

    * **${CONFIG_URI}** - The GitHub address of the configuration YAML file that
      you want to use to deploy Kubeflow. The URI used in this guide is
      {{% config-uri-k8s-istio %}}.
      When you run `kfctl apply` or `kfctl build` (see the next step), kfctl creates
      a local version of the configuration YAML file which you can further
      customize if necessary.

2. Run this command to check that the resources have been deployed correctly in namespace `kubeflow`:

      ```
      kubectl get all -n kubeflow
      ```  

3. Open the Kubeflow Dashboard

    The default installation does not create an external endpoint but you can use port-forwarding to visit your cluster.
    Run the following command:

     ```
     kubectl port-forward svc/istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system 8080:80
     ```

     Next, open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

    To open the dashboard to a public IP address, you should first implement a solution to prevent unauthorized access.
    You can read more about Azure authentication options from [Access Control for Azure Deployment](/docs/azure/authentication).

  You can find general information about Kubeflow configuration in the guide to [configuring Kubeflow with kfctl and kustomize](/docs/methods/kfctl/kustomize/).
