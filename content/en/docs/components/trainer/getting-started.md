This guide describes how to get started with Kubeflow Trainer and run distributed training
with PyTorch.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have access to a Kubernetes cluster with Kubeflow Trainer
control plane installed. If it is not set up yet, follow
[the installation guide](/docs/components/trainer/operator-guides/installation) to quickly deploy
Kubeflow Trainer.

### Installing the Kubeflow Python SDK

Install the latest Kubeflow Python SDK version directly from the source repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/kubeflow/trainer.git@master#subdirectory=sdk
```

## Getting Started with PyTorch

Before creating a Kubeflow TrainJob, defines the training function that handles end-to-end model
training. Each PyTorch node will execute this function within the configured distributed environment.
Typically, this function includes steps to download the dataset, initialize the model, and train it.

Kubeflow Trainer automatically sets up the distributed environment for PyTorch, enabling
[Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html).

```python
def train_pytorch():
    import os

    import torch
    from torch import nn
    import torch.nn.functional as F

    from torchvision import datasets, transforms
    import torch.distributed as dist
    from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, DistributedSampler

    # [1] Configure CPU/GPU device and distributed backend.
    # Kubeflow Trainer will automatically configure the distributed environment.
    device, backend = ("cuda", "nccl") if torch.cuda.is_available() else ("cpu", "gloo")
    dist.init_process_group(backend=backend)

    local_rank = int(os.getenv("LOCAL_RANK", 0))
    print(
        "Distributed Training with WORLD_SIZE: {}, RANK: {}, LOCAL_RANK: {}.".format(
            dist.get_world_size(),
            dist.get_rank(),
            local_rank,
        )
    )

    # [2] Define PyTorch CNN Model to be trained.
    class Net(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super(Net, self).__init__()
            self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 20, 5, 1)
            self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(20, 50, 5, 1)
            self.fc1 = nn.Linear(4 * 4 * 50, 500)
            self.fc2 = nn.Linear(500, 10)

        def forward(self, x):
            x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
            x = F.max_pool2d(x, 2, 2)
            x = F.relu(self.conv2(x))
            x = F.max_pool2d(x, 2, 2)
            x = x.view(-1, 4 * 4 * 50)
            x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
            x = self.fc2(x)
            return F.log_softmax(x, dim=1)

    # [3] Attach model to the correct device.
    device = torch.device(f"{device}:{local_rank}")
    model = nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(Net().to(device))
    model.train()
    optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1, momentum=0.9)

    # [4] Get the Fashion-MNIST dataset and distributed it across all available devices.
    dataset = datasets.FashionMNIST(
        "./data",
        train=True,
        download=True,
        transform=transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor()]),
    )
    train_loader = DataLoader(
        dataset,
        batch_size=100,
        sampler=DistributedSampler(dataset),
    )

    # [5] Define the training loop.
    for epoch in range(3):
        for batch_idx, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(train_loader):
            # Attach tensors to the device.
            inputs, labels = inputs.to(device), labels.to(device)

            # Forward pass
            outputs = model(inputs)
            loss = F.nll_loss(outputs, labels)

            # Backward pass
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            if batch_idx % 10 == 0 and dist.get_rank() == 0:
                print(
                    "Train Epoch: {} [{}/{} ({:.0f}%)]\tLoss: {:.6f}".format(
                        epoch,
                        batch_idx * len(inputs),
                        len(train_loader.dataset),
                        100.0 * batch_idx / len(train_loader),
                        loss.item(),
                    )
                )

    # Wait for the training to complete and destroy to PyTorch distributed process group.
    dist.barrier()
    if dist.get_rank() == 0:
        print("Training is finished")
    dist.destroy_process_group()
```

After configuring the training function, check the available Kubeflow Training Runtimes:

```python
from kubeflow.trainer import TrainerClient, Trainer

for r in TrainerClient().list_runtimes():
    print(f"Runtime: {r.name}")
```

You should be able to see list of available Training Runtimes:

```python
Runtime: torch-distributed
```

Create a TrainJob using the `torch-distributed` Runtime, which scales your training function across
4 PyTorch nodes, every node has 1 GPU.

```python
job_id = TrainerClient().train(
    trainer=Trainer(
        func=train_pytorch,
        num_nodes=4,
        resources_per_node={
            "cpu": 5,
            "memory": "16Gi",
            "gpu": 1, # Comment this line if you don't have GPUs.
        },
    ),
    runtime_ref="torch-distributed",
)
```

You can check the components of the TrainJob and the number of devices each PyTorch node is using:

```python
for c in TrainerClient().get_job(name=job_id).components:
    print(f"Component: {c.name}, Status: {c.status}, Devices: {c.device} x {c.device_count}")
```

The output:

```python
Component: trainer-node-0, Status: Succeeded, Devices: gpu x 1
Component: trainer-node-1, Status: Succeeded, Devices: gpu x 1
Component: trainer-node-2, Status: Succeeded, Devices: gpu x 1
Component: trainer-node-3, Status: Succeeded, Devices: gpu x 1
```

Finally, you can check the training logs from the master node:

```python
logs = TrainerClient().get_job_logs(name=job_id)

print(logs["trainer-node-0"])
```

Since training was run on 4 GPUs, each PyTorch node processes 60,000 / 4 = 15,000 images
from the dataset:
