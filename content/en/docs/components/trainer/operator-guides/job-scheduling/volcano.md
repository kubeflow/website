This guide describes how to enable **gang scheduling** and **advanced resource management** with
the [Volcano Scheduler](https://volcano.sh/en/docs/) in Kubeflow Trainer.

By integrating Volcano, you can ensure that all Pods of a training job start together (gang scheduling),
and take advantage of advanced AI-specific scheduling capabilities like priority scheduling, queue-based resource management, and
network topology–aware scheduling.

## Prerequisites

You have to [install Volcano](https://volcano.sh/en/docs/installation/) in your Kubernetes cluster before enabling the Volcano gang scheduling policy.

## Enable Volcano Plugin

Volcano scheduling can be enabled through the `podGroupPolicy` field in your `TrainJob` specification.

### Gang Scheduling

To enable gang scheduling, specify the `volcano` policy in your runtime:

```yaml
podGroupPolicy:
  volcano:
    {}
```
This configuration automatically creates Volcano `PodGroups` for your training job.


### Topology Aware Scheduling

Volcano also supports **network topology–aware scheduling**, which helps place Pods close to each other
to minimize communication latency in distributed training. You can configure this behavior under the volcano policy:

```yaml
podGroupPolicy:
  volcano:
    networkTopology:
      mode: hard
      highestTierAllowed: 1
```


### Using Queues for Priority Scheduling

Volcano supports queue-based resource management, where multiple PodGroups are placed in queues
and scheduled based on their priority and available capacity.

First, you have to [create a custom queue](https://volcano.sh/en/docs/tutorials/#step-1-create-a-custom-queue).

Then, reference this queue in the annotations of `TrainingRuntime` or `TrainJob`:

```yaml
spec:
  annotations:
    scheduling.volcano.sh/queue-name: "high-priority-queue"
```
