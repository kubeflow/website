Kubeflow Notebooks natively supports three types of notebooks, [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), [RStudio](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio), and [Visual Studio Code (code-server)](https://github.com/cdr/code-server), but any web-based IDE should work.
Notebook servers run as containers inside a Kubernetes Pod, which means the type of IDE (and which packages are installed) is determined by the Docker image you pick for your server.

## Images

We provide a number of [example container images](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/tree/master/components/example-notebook-servers) to get you started.

### Base Images

These images provide a common starting point for Kubeflow Notebook containers.
See [custom images](#custom-images) to learn how to extend them with your own packages.

### Image Dependency Chart

This flow-chart shows how our notebook container images depend on each other.

## Custom Images

Packages installed by users __after spawning__ a Kubeflow Notebook will only last the lifetime of the pod (unless installed into a PVC-backed directory).

To ensure packages are preserved throughout Pod restarts users will need to either:
1. [Build custom images that include them](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/tree/master/components/example-notebook-servers#custom-images), or
2. Ensure they are installed in a PVC-backed directory

### Image Requirements

For Kubeflow Notebooks to work with a container image, the image must:
- expose an HTTP interface on port `8888`:
  - kubeflow sets an environment variable `NB_PREFIX` at runtime with the URL path we expect the container be listening under
  - kubeflow uses IFrames, so ensure your application sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` in HTTP response headers
- run as a user called `jovyan`:
  - the home directory of `jovyan` should be `/home/jovyan`
  - the UID of `jovyan` should be `1000`
- start successfully with an empty PVC mounted at `/home/jovyan`:
  - kubeflow mounts a PVC at `/home/jovyan` to keep state across Pod restarts
  
## Next steps

- Use your container image by specifying it when spawning your notebook server.
