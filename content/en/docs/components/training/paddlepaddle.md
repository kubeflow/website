This page describes `PaddleJob` for training a machine learning model with [PaddlePaddle](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/).

`PaddleJob` is a Kubernetes
[custom resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
to run PaddlePaddle training jobs on Kubernetes. The Kubeflow implementation of
`PaddleJob` is in [`training-operator`](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator).

## Installing Paddle Operator

If you haven't already done so please follow the [Getting Started Guide](/docs/started/getting-started/) to deploy Kubeflow.

> By default, Paddle Operator will be deployed as a controller in training operator.

If you want to install a standalone version of the training operator without Kubeflow,
see the [kubeflow/training-operator's README](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator#installation).

### Verify that PaddleJob support is included in your Kubeflow deployment

Check that the Paddle custom resource is installed:

```
kubectl get crd
```

The output should include `paddlejobs.kubeflow.org` like the following:

```
NAME                                            CREATED AT
...
paddlejobs.kubeflow.org                         2022-10-21T05:37:53Z
...
```

Check that the Training operator is running via:

```
kubectl get pods -n kubeflow
```

The output should include `job-name-worker-<rank>` like the following:

```
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
training-operator-worker-0          1/1     Running   0          4m37s
training-operator-worker-1          1/1     Running   0          4m37s
```

## Creating a PaddlePaddle training job

You can create a training job by defining a `PaddleJob` config file. See the manifests for the [distributed example](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/blob/master/examples/paddlepaddle/simple-cpu.yaml). You may change the config file based on your requirements.

Deploy the `PaddleJob` resource to start training:

```
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/training-operator/master/examples/paddlepaddle/simple-cpu.yaml
```

You should now be able to see the created pods matching the specified number of replicas.

```
kubectl get pods -l job-name=paddle-simple-cpu -n kubeflow
```

Training takes several minutes on a cpu cluster. Logs can be inspected to see its training progress.

```
PODNAME=$(kubectl get pods -l job-name=paddle-simple-cpu,replica-type=worker,replica-index=0 -o name -n kubeflow)
kubectl logs -f ${PODNAME} -n kubeflow
```

## Monitoring a PaddleJob

```
kubectl get -o yaml paddlejobs paddle-simple-cpu -n kubeflow
```

See the status section to monitor the job status. Here is sample output when the job is successfully completed.
