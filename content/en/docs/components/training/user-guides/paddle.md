This page describes `PaddleJob` for training a machine learning model with [PaddlePaddle](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/).

`PaddleJob` is a Kubernetes
[custom resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
to run PaddlePaddle training jobs on Kubernetes. The Kubeflow implementation of
`PaddleJob` is in [`training-operator`](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator).

**Note**: `PaddleJob` doesnâ€™t work in a user namespace by default because of
Istio [automatic sidecar injection](https://istio.io/v1.3/docs/setup/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/#automatic-sidecar-injection).
In order to get it running, it needs annotation `sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false"`
to disable it for either `PaddleJob` pods or namespace.
To view an example of how to add this annotation to your `yaml` file,
see the [`TFJob` documentation](/docs/components/training/user-guides/tensorflow/).

## Creating a PaddlePaddle training job

You can create a training job by defining a `PaddleJob` config file. See the manifests for the [distributed example](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/blob/master/examples/paddlepaddle/simple-cpu.yaml). You may change the config file based on your requirements.

Deploy the `PaddleJob` resource to start training:

```
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/training-operator/master/examples/paddlepaddle/simple-cpu.yaml
```

You should now be able to see the created pods matching the specified number of replicas.

```
kubectl get pods -l job-name=paddle-simple-cpu -n kubeflow
```

Training takes several minutes on a cpu cluster. Logs can be inspected to see its training progress.

```
PODNAME=$(kubectl get pods -l job-name=paddle-simple-cpu,replica-type=worker,replica-index=0 -o name -n kubeflow)
kubectl logs -f ${PODNAME} -n kubeflow
```

## Monitoring a PaddleJob

```
kubectl get -o yaml paddlejobs paddle-simple-cpu -n kubeflow
```

See the status section to monitor the job status. Here is sample output when the job is successfully completed.
