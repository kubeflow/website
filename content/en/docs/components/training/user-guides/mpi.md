This guide walks you through using MPI for training.

The MPI Operator, `MPIJob`, makes it easy to run allreduce-style distributed training on Kubernetes. Please check out [this blog post](https://medium.com/kubeflow/introduction-to-kubeflow-mpi-operator-and-industry-adoption-296d5f2e6edc) for an introduction to MPI Operator and its industry adoption.

**Note**: `MPIJob` doesnâ€™t work in a user namespace by default because of
Istio [automatic sidecar injection](https://istio.io/v1.3/docs/setup/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/#automatic-sidecar-injection).
In order to get it running, it needs annotation `sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false"`
to disable it for either the `MPIJob` pods or namespace.
To view an example of how to add this annotation to your `yaml` file,
see the [`TFJob` documentation](/docs/components/training/user-guides/tensorflow/).

## Installation

You can deploy the operator with default settings by running the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator
cd mpi-operator
kubectl apply -f deploy/v2beta1/mpi-operator.yaml
```

Alternatively, follow the [getting started guide](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/getting-started/) to deploy Kubeflow.

An alpha version of MPI support was introduced with Kubeflow 0.2.0. You must be using a version of Kubeflow newer than 0.2.0.

You can check whether the MPI Job custom resource is installed via:

```
kubectl get crd
```

The output should include `mpijobs.kubeflow.org` like the following:

```
NAME                                       AGE
...
mpijobs.kubeflow.org                       4d
...
```

If it is not included, you can add it as follows using [kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator
cd mpi-operator
kustomize build manifests/overlays/kubeflow | kubectl apply -f -
```

Note that since Kubernetes v1.14, `kustomize` became a subcommand in `kubectl` so you can also run the following command instead:

Since Kubernetes v1.21, you can use:

```bash
kubectl apply -k manifests/overlays/kubeflow
```

```bash
kubectl kustomize base | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Creating an MPI Job

You can create an MPI job by defining an `MPIJob` config file. See [TensorFlow benchmark example](https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator/blob/master/examples/v2beta1/tensorflow-benchmarks/tensorflow-benchmarks.yaml) config file for launching a multi-node TensorFlow benchmark training job. You may change the config file based on your requirements.

```
cat examples/v2beta1/tensorflow-benchmarks/tensorflow-benchmarks.yaml
```

Deploy the `MPIJob` resource to start training:

```
kubectl apply -f examples/v2beta1/tensorflow-benchmarks/tensorflow-benchmarks.yaml
```

## Scheduling Policy

The MPI Operator supports the [gang-scheduling](/docs/components/training/user-guides/job-scheduling/#running-jobs-with-gang-scheduling).
If you want to modify the PodGroup parameters, you can configure in the following:

```diff
apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v2beta1
kind: MPIJob
metadata:
  name: tensorflow-benchmarks
spec:
  slotsPerWorker: 1
  runPolicy:
    cleanPodPolicy: Running
+   schedulingPolicy:
+     minAvailable: 10
+     queue: test-queue
+     minResources:
+       requests:
+         cpu: 3000m
+     priorityClass: high
+     scheduleTimeoutSeconds: 180
  mpiReplicaSpecs:
...
```

In addition, those fields are passed to the PodGroup for the volcano or the coscheduling plugin according to the following:

- `.spec.runPolicy.schedulingPolicy.minAvailable` defines the minimal number of members to run the PodGroup and is passed to `.spec.minMember`.
  When using this field, you must ensure the application supports resizing (e.g., Elastic Horovod).
- `.spec.runPolicy.schedulingPolicy.queue` defines the queue name to allocate resource for the PodGroup. However, iff you use the volcano as a gang scheduler, this is passed to `.spec.queue`.
- `.spec.runPolicy.schedulingPolicy.minResources` defines the minimal resources of members to run the PodGroup and is passed to `.spec.minResources`.
- `.spec.runPolicy.schedulingPolicy.priorityClass` defines the PodGroup's PriorityClass. However, iff you use the volcano as a gang scheduler, this is passed to `.spec.priorityClassName`.
- `.spec.runPolicy.schedulingPolicy.scheduleTimeutSeconds` defines the maximal time of members to wait before run the PodGroup.
  However, iff you use the coscheduling plugin as a gang scheduler, this is passed to `.spec.scheduleTimeutSeconds`.

Also, if you don't set the fields, the MPI Operator populates them based on the following:

volcano:

- `.spec.runPolicy.schedulingPolicy.minAvailable`: The number of a launcher and workers.
- `.spec.runPolicy.schedulingPolicy.queue`: A value of the `scheduling.volcano.sh/group-name` in `.spec.annotations`.
- `.spec.runPolicy.schedulingPolicy.minResources`: Nothing is set.
- `.spec.runPolicy.schedulingPolicy.priorityClass`: It uses the priorityClass for the launcher. If one for the launcher doesn't set, it uses one for the workers.

scheduler-plugins:

- `.spec.runPolicy.schedulingPolicy.minAvailable`: The number of a launcher and workers.
- `.spec.runPolicy.schedulingPolicy.minResources`: The sum of resources defined in all containers.
  However, if the number of replicas (`.spec.mpiReplicaSpecs[Launcher].replicas` + `.spec.mpiReplicaSpecs[Worker].replicas`) is more of minMembers,
  it reorders replicas according to each priorityClass setting in `podSpec.priorityClassName` and then resources with a priority less than minMember will not be added to minResources.
  Note that it doesn't account for the priorityClass specified in podSpec.priorityClassName if the priorityClass doesn't exist in the cluster when it reorders replicas.
- `.spec.runPolicy.schedulingPolicy.scheduleTimeutSeconds`: 0

## Monitoring an MPI Job

Once the `MPIJob` resource is created, you should now be able to see the created pods matching the specified number of GPUs. You can also monitor the job status from the status section. Here is sample output when the job is successfully completed.

```
kubectl get -o yaml mpijobs tensorflow-benchmarks
```

```

Training should run for 100 steps and takes a few minutes on a GPU cluster. You can inspect the logs to see the training progress. When the job starts, access the logs from the `launcher` pod:

```
PODNAME=$(kubectl get pods -l mpi_job_name=tensorflow-benchmarks,mpi_role_type=launcher -o name)
kubectl logs -f ${PODNAME}
```

### Join Metrics

With [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics), one can join metrics by labels.
For example `kube_pod_info * on(pod,namespace) group_left label_replace(mpi_operator_job_infos, "pod", "$0", "launcher", ".*")`

## Docker Images

We push Docker images of the [mpioperator on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/mpioperator) for every release.
You can use the following Dockerfile to build the image yourself:

- [mpi-operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator/blob/master/Dockerfile)

Alternative, you can build the image using make:

```bash
make RELEASE_VERSION=dev IMAGE_NAME=registry.example.com/mpi-operator images
```

This will produce an image with the tag `registry.example.com/mpi-operator:dev`.
