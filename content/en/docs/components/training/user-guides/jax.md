This page describes `JAXJob` for training a machine learning model with [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The `JAXJob` is a Kubernetes
[custom resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
to run JAX training jobs on Kubernetes. The Kubeflow implementation of
the `JAXJob` is in the [`training-operator`](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator).

The current custom resource for JAX has been tested to run multiple processes on CPUs using [gloo](https://github.com/facebookincubator/gloo) for communication between CPUs. Worker with replica 0 is recognized as a JAX coordinator. Process 0 will start a JAX coordinator service exposed via the IP address of process 0 in your cluster, together with a port available on that process, to which the other processes in the cluster will connect. We are looking for user feedback to run JAXJob on GPUs and TPUs.

## Creating a JAX training job

You can create a training job by defining a `JAXJob` config file. See the manifests for the [simple JAXJob example](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/blob/master/examples/jax/cpu-demo/demo.yaml).
You may change the Job config file based on your requirements.

Deploy the `JAXJob` resource to start training:

```
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/training-operator/refs/heads/master/examples/jax/cpu-demo/demo.yaml
```

You should now be able to see the created pods matching the specified number of replicas.

```
kubectl get pods -n kubeflow -l training.kubeflow.org/job-name=jaxjob-simple
```

Distributed computation takes several minutes on a CPU cluster. Logs can be inspected to see its progress.

```
PODNAME=$(kubectl get pods -l training.kubeflow.org/job-name=jaxjob-simple,training.kubeflow.org/replica-type=worker,training.kubeflow.org/replica-index=0 -o name -n kubeflow)
kubectl logs -f ${PODNAME} -n kubeflow
```

```

## Monitoring a JAXJob

```
kubectl get -o yaml jaxjobs jaxjob-simple -n kubeflow
```

See the status section to monitor the job status. Here is sample output when the job is successfully completed.
