This guide walks you through using MXNet with Kubeflow.

## Installing MXNet Operator

If you haven't already done so please follow the [Getting Started Guide](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/getting-started/) to deploy Kubeflow.

A version of MXNet support was introduced with Kubeflow 0.2.0. You must be using a version of Kubeflow newer than 0.2.0.

## Verify that MXNet support is included in your Kubeflow deployment

Check that the MXNet custom resource is installed

```
kubectl get crd
```

The output should include `mxjobs.kubeflow.org`

```
NAME                                           AGE
...
mxjobs.kubeflow.org                            4d
...
```

If it is not included you can add it as follows

```
git clone https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests
cd manifests/mxnet-job/mxnet-operator
kubectl kustomize base | kubectl apply -f -
```

Alternatively, you can deploy the operator with default settings without using kustomize by running the following from the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/kubeflow/mxnet-operator.git
cd mxnet-operator
kubectl create -f manifests/crd-v1beta1.yaml 
kubectl create -f manifests/rbac.yaml 
kubectl create -f manifests/deployment.yaml
```

## Creating a MXNet training job


You create a training job by defining a MXJob with MXTrain mode and then creating it with


```
kubectl create -f examples/v1beta1/train/mx_job_dist_gpu.yaml
```


## Creating a TVM tuning job (AutoTVM)


[TVM](https://docs.tvm.ai/tutorials/) is a end to end deep learning compiler stack, you can easily run AutoTVM with mxnet-operator. 
You can create a auto tuning job by define a type of MXTune job and then creating it with


```
kubectl create -f examples/v1beta1/tune/mx_job_tune_gpu.yaml
```


Before you use the auto-tuning example, there is some preparatory work need to be finished in advance. To let TVM tune your network, you should create a docker image which has TVM module. Then, you need a auto-tuning script to specify which network will be tuned and set the auto-tuning parameters, For more details, please see https://docs.tvm.ai/tutorials/autotvm/tune_relay_mobile_gpu.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-autotvm-tune-relay-mobile-gpu-py. Finally, you need a startup script to start the auto-tuning program. In fact, mxnet-operator will set all the parameters as environment variables and the startup script need to reed these variable and then transmit them to auto-tuning script. We provide an example under examples/v1beta1/tune/, tuning result will be saved in a log file like resnet-18.log in the example we gave. You can refer it for details.


## Monitoring a MXNet Job


To get the status of your job

```bash
kubectl get -o yaml mxjobs ${JOB}
```   

Here is sample output for an example job

```yaml
