This tutorial helps you get started with KFP.

Before you begin, you need the following prerequisites:

  * **An existing Kubernetes cluster**: If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster, see [Installation][installation] for instructions about how to get one.
  
  * **The [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) command-line tool**: Install and configure your [kubectl context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/) to connect with your cluster.
  
  * Run the following script to install the KFP SDK:
    ```shell
    pip install kfp --pre
    ```

    **Note:** This command installs KFP v2, which is in pre-release stage and is not yet stable. The v2 documentation is being developed continually and some of the links to the v2 documentation might be unavailable.

After you complete the prerequisites, click each step to view the instructions:

  <hr/>
  This step shows how to deploy a KFP standalone instance into an existing Kubernetes cluster.

  Run the following script after replacing `PIPELINE_VERSION` with the desired version of KFP:

  ```shell
  export PIPELINE_VERSION="2.0.0-alpha.4"

  kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/manifests/kustomize/cluster-scoped-resources?ref=$PIPELINE_VERSION"
  kubectl wait --for condition=established --timeout=60s crd/applications.app.k8s.io
  kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/manifests/kustomize/env/dev?ref=$PIPELINE_VERSION"
  ```

  After you deploy Kubernetes, obtain your KFP endpoint by following [these instructions][installation].

  <summary><a name="kfp_qs_step2"></a><h2 style="display:inline;">Step 2: Create and run a simple pipeline using the KFP SDK</h2></summary>
  <hr/>
This step shows how to use the KFP SDK to compose a pipeline and submit it for execution by KFP.

The following simple pipeline adds two integers, and then adds another integer to the result to come up with a final sum.

```python
from kfp import dsl
from kfp import client


@dsl.component
def addition_component(num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
    return num1 + num2


@dsl.pipeline(name='addition-pipeline')
def my_pipeline(a: int, b: int, c: int = 10):
    add_task_1 = addition_component(num1=a, num2=b)
    add_task_2 = addition_component(num1=add_task_1.output, num2=c)


endpoint = '<KFP_ENDPOINT>'
kfp_client = client.Client(host=endpoint)
run = kfp_client.create_run_from_pipeline_func(
    my_pipeline,
    arguments={
        'a': 1,
        'b': 2
    },
)
url = f'{endpoint}/#/runs/details/{run.run_id}'
print(url)
```

The above code consists of the following parts:

* In the first part, the following lines create a [lightweight Python component][lightweight-python-component] by using the `@dsl.component` decorator:
  ```python
  @dsl.component
  def addition_component(num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
    return num1 + num2
  ```
  The `@dsl.component` decorator transforms a Python function into a component, which can be used within a pipeline. You are required to specify the type annotations on the parameters as well as the return value, as these inform the KFP executor how to serialize and deserialize the data passed between components. The type annotations and return value also enable the KFP compiler to type check any data that is passed between pipeline tasks.

* In the second part, the following lines [create a pipeline][pipelines] by using the `@dsl.pipeline` decorator:
  ```python
  @dsl.pipeline(name='addition-pipeline')
  def my_pipeline(a: int, b: int, c: int = 10):
    ...
  ```
  Like the component decorator, the `@dsl.pipeline` decorator transforms a Python function into a pipeline that can be executed by the KFP backend. The pipeline can have arguments. These arguments also require type annotations. In this example, the argument `c` has a default value of `10`.

* In the third part, the following lines connect the components together to form a computational directed acyclic graph (DAG) within the body of the pipeline function:
  ```python    
  add_task_1 = addition_component(num1=a, num2=b)
  add_task_2 = addition_component(num1=add_task_1.output, num2=c)
  ```
  This example instantiates two different addition tasks from the same component named `addition_component`, by passing different arguments to the component function for each task, as follows:
  *  The first task accepts pipeline parameters `a` and `b` as input arguments.
  *  The second task accepts `add_task_1.output`, which is the output from `add_task_1`, as the first input argument. The pipeline parameter `c` is the second input argument.

  You must always pass component arguments as keyword arguments.

* In the fourth part, the following lines instantiate a KFP client using the endpoint obtained in [step 1](#kfp_qs_step1) and submit the pipeline to the KFP backend with the required pipeline arguments:

  ```python
  endpoint = '<KFP_ENDPOINT>'
  kfp_client = client.Client(host=endpoint)
  run = kfp_client.create_run_from_pipeline_func(
    my_pipeline,
    arguments={
      'a': 1,
      'b': 2
    },
  )
  url = f'{endpoint}/#/runs/details/{run.run_id}'
  print(url)
  ```

  In this example, replace `endpoint` with the KFP endpoint URL you obtained in the from [step 1](#kfp_qs_step1).

  Alternatively, you can compile the pipeline to [IR YAML][ir-yaml] for use at another time:

  ```python
  from kfp import compiler

  compiler.Compiler().compile(pipeline_func=my_pipeline, package_path='pipeline.yaml')
  ```

  <summary><a name="kfp_qs_step4"></a><h2 style="display:inline;">Step 4: Build a more advanced ML pipeline</h2></summary>
  <hr/>
This step shows how to build a more advanced machine learning (ML) pipeline that demonstrates additional KFP pipeline composition features.

The following ML pipeline creates a dataset, normalizes the features of the dataset as a preprocessing step, and trains a simple ML model on the data using different hyperparameters:

```python
from typing import List

from kfp import client
from kfp import dsl
from kfp.dsl import Dataset
from kfp.dsl import Input
from kfp.dsl import Model
from kfp.dsl import Output


@dsl.component(packages_to_install=['pandas==1.3.5'])
def create_dataset(iris_dataset: Output[Dataset]):
    import pandas as pd

    csv_url = 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data'
    col_names = [
        'Sepal_Length', 'Sepal_Width', 'Petal_Length', 'Petal_Width', 'Labels'
    ]
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_url, names=col_names)

    with open(iris_dataset.path, 'w') as f:
        df.to_csv(f)


@dsl.component(packages_to_install=['pandas==1.3.5', 'scikit-learn==1.0.2'])
def normalize_dataset(
    input_iris_dataset: Input[Dataset],
    normalized_iris_dataset: Output[Dataset],
    standard_scaler: bool,
    min_max_scaler: bool,
):
    if standard_scaler is min_max_scaler:
        raise ValueError(
            'Exactly one of standard_scaler or min_max_scaler must be True.')

    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    with open(input_iris_dataset.path) as f:
        df = pd.read_csv(f)
    labels = df.pop('Labels')

    if standard_scaler:
        scaler = StandardScaler()
    if min_max_scaler:
        scaler = MinMaxScaler()

    df = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(df))
    df['Labels'] = labels
    with open(normalized_iris_dataset.path, 'w') as f:
        df.to_csv(f)


@dsl.component(packages_to_install=['pandas==1.3.5', 'scikit-learn==1.0.2'])
def train_model(
    normalized_iris_dataset: Input[Dataset],
    model: Output[Model],
    n_neighbors: int,
):
    import pickle

    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

    with open(normalized_iris_dataset.path) as f:
        df = pd.read_csv(f)

    y = df.pop('Labels')
    X = df

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)

    clf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=n_neighbors)
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    with open(model.path, 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(clf, f)


@dsl.pipeline(name='iris-training-pipeline')
def my_pipeline(
    standard_scaler: bool,
    min_max_scaler: bool,
    neighbors: List[int],
):
    create_dataset_task = create_dataset()

    normalize_dataset_task = normalize_dataset(
        input_iris_dataset=create_dataset_task.outputs['iris_dataset'],
        standard_scaler=True,
        min_max_scaler=False)

    with dsl.ParallelFor(neighbors) as n_neighbors:
        train_model(
            normalized_iris_dataset=normalize_dataset_task
            .outputs['normalized_iris_dataset'],
            n_neighbors=n_neighbors)


endpoint = '<KFP_UI_URL>'
kfp_client = client.Client(host=endpoint)
run = kfp_client.create_run_from_pipeline_func(
    my_pipeline,
    arguments={
        'min_max_scaler': True,
        'standard_scaler': False,
        'neighbors': [3, 6, 9]
    },
)
url = f'{endpoint}/#/runs/details/{run.run_id}'
print(url)
```

This example introduces the following new features in the pipeline:

*  Some Python **packages to install** are added at component runtime, using the `packages_to_install` argument on the `@dsl.component` decorator, as follows:

    `@dsl.component(packages_to_install=['pandas==1.3.5'])`

    To use a library after installing it, you must include its import statements within the scope of the component function, so that the library is imported at component runtime.

* **Input and output artifacts** of types `Dataset` and `Model` are introduced in the component signature to describe the input and output artifacts of the components. This is done using the type annotation generics `Input[]` and `Output[]` for input and output artifacts respectively.

  Within the scope of a component, artifacts can be read (for inputs) and written (for outputs) via the `.path` attribute. The KFP backend ensures that *input* artifact files are copied *to* the executing pod local file system from the remote storage at runtime, so that the component function can read input artifacts from the local file system. By comparison, *output* artifact files are copied *from* the local file system of the pod to remote storage, when the component finishes running. This way, the output artifacts persist outside the pod. In both cases, the component author needs to interact with the local file system only to create persistent artifacts.

  The arguments for the parameters annotated with `Output[]` are not passed to components by the pipeline author. The KFP backend passes this artifact during component runtime, so that component authors don't need to be concerned about the path to which the output artifacts are written. After an output artifact is written, the backend executing the component recognizes the KFP artifact types (`Dataset` or `Model`), and organizes them on the Dashboard.

  An output artifact can be passed as an input to a downstream component using `.outputs` attribute of the source task and the output artifact parameter name, as follows:
  
  `create_dataset_task.outputs['iris_dataset']`

* One of the **DSL control flow features**, `dsl.ParallelFor`, is used. It is a context manager that lets pipeline authors create tasks. These tasks execute in parallel in a loop. Using `dsl.ParallelFor` to iterate over the `neighbors` pipeline argument lets you execute the  `train_model` component with different arguments and test multiple hyperparameters in one pipeline run. Other control flow features include `dsl.Condition` and `dsl.ExitHandler`.
</details>

Congratulations! You now have a KFP deployment, an end-to-end ML pipeline, and an introduction to the UI. That's just the beginning of KFP pipeline and Dashboard features.
