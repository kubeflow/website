By default, you can use Kubeflow Pipelines deployment manifests as provided,
which aim to offer a standard configuration for most use cases. At the meantime,
customizations are available for more advanced usage.

When deploying Kubeflow Pipelines servers, you can pass various environment variables
to customize the behavior of servers.

## Frontend Server

When deploying frontend server called `ml-pipeline-ui`, you can pass various environment
variables to customize the server behavior for your namespace. Some examples are shown
in the [ml-pipeline-ui-deployment.yaml](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/b630d5c8ae7559be0011e67f01e3aec1946ef765/manifests/kustomize/base/pipeline/ml-pipeline-ui-deployment.yaml#L32-L50).

### Artifact storage endpoint allowlist

You can configure `ALLOWED_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN_REGEX` to allowlist object storage endpoint
that your frontend server will fetch artifacts from. If the domain that frontend server
tries to fetch does not match the regular expression defined in
`ALLOWED_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN_REGEX`, it will return error to users that the requested domain
is not allowed.

#### Standalone Kubeflow Pipelines deployment

By default, the value for `ALLOWED_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN_REGEX` is `"^.*$"`. You can customize
this value for your users, for example: `^.*.yourdomain$` in the
[ml-pipeline-ui-deployment.yaml](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/b630d5c8ae7559be0011e67f01e3aec1946ef765/manifests/kustomize/base/pipeline/ml-pipeline-ui-deployment.yaml#L32-L50).


#### Full fledged Kubeflow deployment

For full fledged Kubeflow, each namespace corresponds to a project with the same name.
To configure the `ALLOWED_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN_REGEX` value for user namespace, add an entry in `ml-pipeline-ui-artifact`
just like this example in [sync.py](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/b630d5c8ae7559be0011e67f01e3aec1946ef765/manifests/kustomize/base/installs/multi-user/pipelines-profile-controller/sync.py#L304-L310) for `ALLOWED_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN_REGEX` environment variable,
the entry is identical to the environment variable instruction in Standalone Kubeflow Pipelines
deployment.
