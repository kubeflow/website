The easiest way to get started authoring components is by creating a Lightweight Python Component. We saw an example of a Lightweight Python Component with `say_hello` in the [Hello World pipeline example][hello-world-pipeline]. Here is another Lightweight Python Component that adds two integers together:

```python
from kfp import dsl

@dsl.component
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```

Lightweight Python Components are constructed by decorating Python functions with the [`@dsl.component`][dsl-component] decorator. The `@dsl.component` decorator transforms your function into a KFP component that can be executed as a remote function by a KFP conformant-backend, either independently or as a single step in a larger pipeline.

### Python function requirements
To decorate a function with the `@dsl.component` decorator it must meet two requirements:

1. **Type annotations:** The function inputs and outputs must have valid KFP [type annotations][data-types].

    There are two categories of inputs and outputs in KFP: [parameters][parameters] and [artifacts][artifacts]. There are specific types of parameters and artifacts within each category. Every input and output will have a specific type indicated by its type annotation.

    In the preceding `add` component, both inputs `a` and `b` are parameters typed `int`. There is one output, also typed `int`.

    Valid parameter annotations include Python's built-in `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `typing.Dict`, and `typing.List`. Artifact annotations are discussed in detail in [Data Types: Artifacts][artifacts].

2. **Hermetic:** The Python function may not reference any symbols defined outside of its body.

    For example, if you wish to use a constant, the constant must be defined inside the function:

    ```python
    @dsl.component
    def double(a: int) -> int:
        """Succeeds at runtime."""
        VALID_CONSTANT = 2
        return VALID_CONSTANT * a
    ```

    By comparison, the following is invalid and will fail at runtime:

    ```python
    # non-example!
    INVALID_CONSTANT = 2

    @dsl.component
    def errored_double(a: int) -> int:
        """Fails at runtime."""
        return INVALID_CONSTANT * a
    ```

    Imports must also be included in the function body:

    ```python
    @dsl.component
    def print_env():
        import os
        print(os.environ)
    ```

    For many realistic components, hermeticism can be a fairly constraining requirement. [Containerized Python Components][containerized-python-components] is a more flexible authoring approach that drops this requirement.

### dsl.component decorator arguments
In the above examples, we used the [`@dsl.component`][dsl-component] decorator with only one argument: the Python function. The decorator accepts some additional arguments.

#### packages_to_install

Most realistic Lightweight Python Components will depend on other Python libraries. You can pass a list of requirements to `packages_to_install` and the component will install these packages at runtime before executing the component function.

This is similar to including requirements in a [`requirements.txt`][requirements-txt] file.

```python
@dsl.component(packages_to_install=['numpy==1.21.6'])
def sin(val: float = 3.14) -> float:
    return np.sin(val).item()
```

**Note:** As a production software best practice, prefer using [Containerized Python Components][containerized-python-components] when your component specifies `packages_to_install` to eliminate installation of your dependencies at runtime.

#### pip_index_urls

`pip_index_urls` exposes the ability to pip install `packages_to_install` from package indices other than the default [PyPI.org][pypi-org].

When you set `pip_index_urls`, KFP passes these indices to [`pip install`][pip-install]'s [`--index-url`][pip-index-url] and [`--extra-index-url`][pip-extra-index-url] options. It also sets each index as a `--trusted-host`.

Take the following component:

```python
@dsl.component(packages_to_install=['custom-ml-package==0.0.1', 'numpy==1.21.6'],
               pip_index_urls=['http://myprivaterepo.com/simple', 'http://pypi.org/simple'],
)
def comp():
    from custom_ml_package import model_trainer
    import numpy as np
    ...
```

These arguments approximately translate to the following `pip install` command:

```sh
pip install custom-ml-package==0.0.1 numpy==1.21.6 kfp==2 --index-url http://myprivaterepo.com/simple --trusted-host http://myprivaterepo.com/simple --extra-index-url http://pypi.org/simple --trusted-host http://pypi.org/simple
```

Note that when you set `pip_index_urls`, KFP does not include `'https://pypi.org/simple'` automatically. If you wish to pip install packages from a private repository _and_ the default public repository, you should include both the private and default URLs as shown in the preceding component `comp`.

#### base_image

When you create a Lightweight Python Component, your Python function code is extracted by the KFP SDK to be executed inside a container at pipeline runtime. By default, the container image used is [`python:3.7`](https://hub.docker.com/_/python). You can override this image by providing an argument to `base_image`. This can be useful if your code requires a specific Python version or other dependencies not included in the default image.

```python
@dsl.component(base_image='python:3.8')
def print_py_version():
    import sys
    print(sys.version)
```

#### install_kfp_package

`install_kfp_package` can be used together with `pip_index_urls` to provide granular control over installation of the `kfp` package at component runtime.

By default, Python Components install `kfp` at runtime. This is required to define symbols used by your component (such as [artifact annotations][artifacts]) and to access additional KFP library code required to execute your component remotely. If `install_kfp_package` is `False`, `kfp` will not be installed via the normal automatic mechanism. Instead, you can use `packages_to_install` and `pip_index_urls` to install a different version of `kfp`, possibly from a non-default pip index URL.

Note that setting `install_kfp_package` to `False` is rarely necessary and is discouraged for the majority of use cases.

#### additional_funcs

`additional_funcs` is used to include a list of additional functions to include in the component.

These functions will be available to the main function. This is useful for adding util functions that are shared across multiple components but are not packaged as an importable Python package.

```python
def add(input_one: int, input_two: int) -> int:
    return input_one + input_two

@dsl.component(
    additional_funcs=[add])
def quick_add(input_one: int, input_two: int):
    return add(input_one, input_two)
```

#### embedded_artifact_path

`embedded_artifact_path` is an optional path that can be used to embed a local directory or file into the component. At runtime the embedded content is extracted into a temporary
directory and made available via parameters annotated as `dsl.EmbeddedInput[T]`. 

For a directory, the injected artifact's `path` points to the extraction root (temp directory containing the directory's contents)

For a single file, the injected artifact's `path` points to the extracted file.

The extraction root is also prepended to `sys.path` to enable importing embedded Python modules.

```python
@dsl.component(embedded_artifact_path=tmpdir_path)
def read_embedded_artifact_dir(artifact: dsl.EmbeddedInput[dsl.Dataset]):
    import os

    with open(os.path.join(artifact.path, "log.txt"), "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        log = f.read()

    return log
```

#### task_config_passthroughs

`task_config_passthroughs` can be used to pass a list of one or more task configurations (e.g. resources, env, volumes etc.) through to the component.

This is useful when the component launches another Kubernetes resource (e.g. a Kubeflow Trainer job). Use `task_config_passthroughs` in conjunction with `dsl.TaskConfig`.

```python
@dsl.component(
    packages_to_install=["kubernetes"],
    task_config_passthroughs=[
        dsl.TaskConfigField.RESOURCES,
        dsl.TaskConfigPassthrough(field=dsl.TaskConfigField.ENV, apply_to_task=True),
    ],
)
def train(num_nodes: int, workspace_path: str, output_model: dsl.Output[dsl.Model], task_config: dsl.TaskConfig):
    import os
    import shutil
    from kubernetes import client as k8s_client, config
    config.load_incluster_config()
    train_job = {
        "apiVersion": "trainer.kubeflow.org/v1alpha1",
        "kind": "TrainJob",
        "metadata": {"name": f"kfp-train-job", "namespace": "sample-namespace"},
        "spec": {
            "runtimeRef": {"name": "torch-distributed"},
            "trainer": {
                "numNodes": num_nodes,
                "resourcesPerNode": task_config.resources,
                "env": task_config.env,
                "command": ["python", "-c", "with open('/kfp-workspace/model', 'w') as f: f.write('hello')"],
            },
        },
    }
    api_client = k8s_client.ApiClient()
    custom_objects_api = k8s_client.CustomObjectsApi(api_client)
    response = custom_objects_api.create_namespaced_custom_object(
        group="trainer.kubeflow.org",
        version="v1alpha1",
        namespace="sample-namespace",
        plural="trainjobs",
        body=train_job,
    )
    shutil.copy(os.path.join(workspace_path, "model"), output_model.path)
```
