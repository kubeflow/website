## Overview

One of the benefits of KFP is cross-platform portability. 
The KFP SDK compiles pipeline definitions to [IR YAML][ir-yaml] which can be read and executed by different backends, including the Kubeflow Pipelines [open source backend][oss-be] and [Vertex AI Pipelines](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/introduction).

For cases where features are not portable across platforms, users may author pipelines with platform-specific functionality via KFP SDK platform-specific plugin libraries.
In general, platform-specific plugin libraries provide functions that act on tasks similarly to [task-level configuration methods][task-level-config-methods] provided by the KFP SDK directly. 

<!-- TODO: add docs on how to create a platform-specific authoring library -->

## kfp-kubernetes

Currently, the only KFP SDK platform-specific plugin library is [`kfp-kubernetes`][kfp-kubernetes-pypi], which is supported by the Kubeflow Pipelines [open source backend][oss-be] and enables direct access to some Kubernetes resources and functionality.

For more information, see the [`kfp-kubernetes` documentation ][kfp-kubernetes-docs].

### **Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaims**

In this example we will use `kfp-kubernetes` to create a [PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)][persistent-volume], use the PVC to pass data between tasks, and then delete the PVC.

We will assume you have basic familiarity with `PersistentVolume` and `PersistentVolumeClaim` resources in Kubernetes, in addition to [authoring components][authoring-components], and [authoring pipelines][authoring-pipelines] in KFP.

#### **Step 1:** Install the `kfp-kubernetes` library

Run the following command to install the `kfp-kubernetes` library:

```sh
pip install kfp[kubernetes]
```

#### **Step 2:** Create components that read/write to the mount path

Create two simple components that read and write to a file in the `/data` directory. 

In a later step, we will mount a PVC volume to the `/data` directory.

```python
from kfp import dsl

@dsl.component
def producer() -> str:
    with open('/data/file.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write('Hello world')
    with open('/data/file.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    print(content)
    return content

@dsl.component
def consumer() -> str:
    with open('/data/file.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    print(content)
    return content
```

#### **Step 3:** Dynamically provision a PVC using CreatePVC

Now that we have our components, we can begin constructing a pipeline. 

We need a PVC to mount, so we will create one using the `kubernetes.CreatePVC` pre-baked component:

```python
from kfp import kubernetes

@dsl.pipeline
def my_pipeline():
    pvc1 = kubernetes.CreatePVC(
        # can also use pvc_name instead of pvc_name_suffix to use a pre-existing PVC
        pvc_name_suffix='-my-pvc',
        access_modes=['ReadWriteMany'],
        size='5Gi',
        storage_class_name='standard',
    )
```

This component provisions a 5GB PVC from the [StorageClass][storage-class] `'standard'` with the `ReadWriteMany` [access mode][access-mode].
The PVC will be named after the underlying Argo workflow that creates it, concatenated with the suffix `-my-pvc`. The `CreatePVC` component returns this name as the output `'name'`.

> **Note:** [KFP 2.15](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/releases/tag/2.15.0) introduces an upgrade to Argo Workflows v3.7.3

#### **Step 4:** Read and write data to the PVC

Next, we'll use the `mount_pvc` task modifier with the `producer` and `consumer` components. 

We schedule `task2` to run after `task1` so the components don't read and write to the PVC at the same time.

```python
    # write to the PVC
    task1 = producer()
    kubernetes.mount_pvc(
        task1,
        pvc_name=pvc1.outputs['name'],
        mount_path='/data',
    )

    # read to the PVC
    task2 = consumer()
    kubernetes.mount_pvc(
        task2,
        pvc_name=pvc1.outputs['name'],
        mount_path='/reused_data',
    )
    task2.after(task1)
```

#### **Step 5:** Delete the PVC

Finally, we can schedule deletion of the PVC after `task2` finishes to clean up the Kubernetes resources we created.

```python
    delete_pvc1 = kubernetes.DeletePVC(
        pvc_name=pvc1.outputs['name']
    ).after(task2)
```
