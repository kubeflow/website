This page is about __Kubeflow Pipelines V1__, please see the [V2 documentation](/docs/components/pipelines) for the latest information.

Note, while the V2 backend is able to run pipelines submitted by the V1 SDK, we strongly recommend [migrating to the V2 SDK](/docs/components/pipelines/user-guides/migration).
For reference, the final release of the V1 SDK was [`kfp==1.8.22`](https://pypi.org/project/kfp/1.8.22/), and its reference documentation is [available here](https://kubeflow-pipelines.readthedocs.io/en/1.8.22/).
