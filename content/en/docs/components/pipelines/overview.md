{{% kfp-v2-keywords %}}

Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) is a platform for building and deploying portable and scalable machine learning (ML) workflows using Docker containers.

With KFP you can author [components][components] and [pipelines][pipelines] using the [KFP Python SDK][pypi], compile pipelines to an [intermediate representation YAML][ir-yaml], and submit the pipeline to run on a KFP-conformant backend such as the [open source KFP backend][installation] or [Google Cloud Vertex AI Pipelines](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/introduction).

The [open source KFP backend][installation] is available as a core component of Kubeflow or as a standalone installation. Follow the [installation][installation] instructions and [Hello World Pipeline][hello-world-pipeline] example to quickly get started with KFP.

## Why Kubeflow Pipelines?

KFP enables data scientists and machine learning engineers to:

* Author end-to-end ML workflows natively in Python
* Create fully custom ML components or leverage an ecosystem of existing components
* Easily manage, track, and visualize pipeline definitions, runs, experiments, and ML artifacts
* Efficiently use compute resources through parallel task execution and through caching to eliminating redundant executions
* Maintain cross-platform pipeline portability through a platform-neutral [IR YAML pipeline definition][ir-yaml]

## What is a pipeline?

A [pipeline][pipelines] is a definition of a workflow that composes one or more [components][components] together to form a computational directed acyclic graph (DAG). At runtime, each component execution corresponds to a single container execution, which may create ML artifacts. Pipelines may also feature [control flow][control-flow].
