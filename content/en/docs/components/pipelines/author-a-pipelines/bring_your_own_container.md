Container-based components make it easier to use the pre-existed container to build a KFP component. 
The user will control the container entrypoint and is able to define the component by specifying their container, commands, and args in a `ContainerSpec` object. 


## Before you begin

1. Run the following command to install the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK v1.6.2 or higher. If you run this command in a Jupyter
   notebook, restart the kernel after installing the SDK. 


```python
$ pip install --upgrade kfp
```

2. Import the `kfp`, and `kfp.dsl` packages.

```python
import kfp
from kfp.dsl import (
  container_component,
  ContainerSpec,
  pipeline,
  OutputPath,
)
 
```

3. Create an instance of the [`kfp.Client` class][kfp-client] following steps in [connecting to Kubeflow Pipelines using the SDK client][connect-api].

[kfp-client]: https://kubeflow-pipelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/kfp.client.html#kfp.Client
[connect-api]: https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/sdk/connect-api
<!-- TODO: verify the link to connect-api -->


```python
client = kfp.Client() # change arguments accordingly
```

For more information about the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK, see the [SDK reference guide][sdk-ref].

## Getting started with Container-based components

1. This section demonstrates how to get started building container-based components by creating a simple hello world component.

Define your componentâ€™s code as a python function that returns a `dsl.ContainerSpec` object to specify the container image and the commands to be run in the container and wrap the function into a `@container_component` decorator. The decorator will compose a `ComponentSpec` object using the `ContainerSpec` to be compiled for execution. In this example, we use a shell script to demonstrate 
how developers should pass the variables into the program in their containers.  
  <!-- TODO: add hyperlink to source code of ContainerSpec  -->

```python
@container_component
def hello_world_comp(text: str, out_filename: dsl.OutputPath(str)):
    return ContainerSpec(
        image=..., # put your container image on gcs here
        command=['hello_world.sh'],
        args=['--in', text, '--out', out_filename])
```

Meanwhile, add a shell script on your container that outputs the text:
```shell
echo $2 >> $4
```

2. Create pipeline using components. [Learn more about creating and running pipelines][build-pipelines].

[build-pipelines]: TODO


```python
@pipeline(
    name='hello-world-pipeline',
    description='An example pipeline made of container-based component.'
)
def hello_world_pipeline(text: str):
    hello_world_comp(text)
```

3. Compile and run your pipeline. [Learn more about compiling and running pipelines][build-pipelines].

[build-pipelines]: TODO

```python
arguments = {'text': 'Welcome to KFP v2!'}
client.create_run_from_pipeline_func(
    add_pipeline,
    arguments=arguments
)
```
