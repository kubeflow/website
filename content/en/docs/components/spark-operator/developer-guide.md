## Clone the Repository

Clone the Spark operator repository and change to the directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kubeflow/spark-operator.git

cd spark-operator
```

## (Optional) Configure Git Pre-Commit Hooks

Git hooks are useful for identifying simple issues before submission to code review. We run hooks on every commit to automatically generate helm chart `README.md` file from `README.md.gotmpl` file. Before you can run git hooks, you need to have the pre-commit package manager installed as follows:

```shell
# Using pip
pip install pre-commit

# Using conda
conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit

# Using Homebrew
brew install pre-commit
```

To set up the pre-commit hooks, run the following command:

```shell
pre-commit install

pre-commit install-hooks
```

## Use Makefile

We use Makefile to automate common tasks. For example, to build the operator, run the `build-operator` target as follows, and `spark-operator` binary will be build and placed in the `bin` directory:

```bash
make build-operator
```

Dependencies will be automatically downloaded locally to `bin` directory as needed. For example, if you run `make manifests` target, then `controller-gen` tool will be automatically downloaded using `go install` command and then it will be renamed like `controller-gen-vX.Y.Z` and placed in the `bin` directory.

To see the full list of available targets, run the following command:

```bash
$ make help

  make <target>

## Develop with Spark Operator

### Build the Binary

To build the operator, run the following command:

```shell
make build-operator
```

### Build the Docker Image

In case you want to build the operator from the source code, e.g., to test a fix or a feature you write, you can do so following the instructions below.

The easiest way to build the operator without worrying about its dependencies is to just build an image using the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/kubeflow/spark-operator/Dockerfile).

```shell
make docker-build IMAGE_TAG=<image-tag>
```

The operator image is built upon a base Spark image that defaults to `spark:3.5.2`. If you want to use your own Spark image (e.g., an image with a different version of Spark or some custom dependencies), specify the argument `SPARK_IMAGE` as the following example shows:

```shell
docker build --build-arg SPARK_IMAGE=<your Spark image> -t <image-tag> .
```

### Update the API definition

If you have updated the API definition, then you also need to update the auto-generated code. To update the auto-generated code which contains DeepCopy, DeepCopyInto, and DeepCopyObject method implementations, run the following command:

```shell
make generate
```

To update the auto-generated CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), RBAC and WebhookConfiguration manifests, run the following command:

```shell
make manifests
```

After updating the CRD files, run the following command to copy the CRD files to the helm chart directory:

```shell
make update-crd
```

Besides, the API specification documentation `docs/api-docs.md` also needs to be updated. To update the doc, run the following command:

```shell
make build-api-docs
```

### Run Unit Tests

To run unit tests, run the following command:

```shell
make unit-test
```

### Run E2E Tests

To run e2e tests, run the following command:

```shell
# Create a kind cluster
make kind-create-cluster

# Build docker image
make docker-build IMAGE_TAG=local

# Load docker image to kind cluster
make kind-load-image

# Run e2e tests
make e2e-test

# Delete the kind cluster
make kind-delete-cluster
```

## Develop with the Helm Chart

### Run Helm Chart Lint Tests

To run Helm chart lint tests, run the following command:

```shell
$ make helm-lint
Linting charts...

### Run Helm chart unit tests

For detailed information about how to write Helm chart unit tests, please refer to [helm-unittest](https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest). To run the Helm chart unit tests, run the following command:

```shell
$ make helm-unittest

### Build the Helm Docs

The Helm chart `README.md` file is generated by [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs) tool. If you want to update the Helm docs, remember to modify `README.md.gotmpl` rather than `README.md`, then run `make helm-docs` to generate the `README.md` file:

```shell
$ make helm-docs
INFO[2024-04-14T07:29:26Z] Found Chart directories [charts/spark-operator-chart] 
INFO[2024-04-14T07:29:26Z] Generating README Documentation for chart charts/spark-operator-chart 
```

Note that if git pre-commit hooks are set up, `helm-docs` will automatically run before committing any changes. If there are any changes to the `README.md` file, the commit process will be aborted.

## Sign off your commits

After you have made changes to the code, please sign off your commits with `-s` or `--signoff` flag so that the DCO check CI will pass:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```
