This page describes how Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms work in Katib.

## Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS)

The algorithm follows the idea proposed in _Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Parameter Sharing_
by Hieu Pham, Melody Y. Guan, Barret Zoph, Quoc V. Le and Jeff Dean (https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03268)
and _Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning_ by Barret Zoph and
Quoc V. Le (https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578) .

The implementation is based on
[the GitHub of _EfÔ¨Åcient Neural Architecture Search via Parameter Sharing_](https://github.com/melodyguan/enas)
and
[Google Implementation for ENAS](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/enas_lm).
It uses a recurrent neural network with LSTM cells as controller to generate neural architecture candidates.
And this controller network is updated by policy gradients. However, it currently does not support parameter sharing.

### Katib Implementation

Katib represents neural network in the specific format. If number of layers (n) = 12 and number
of possible operations (m) = 6, the definition of an architecture will be like:

```
[2]
[0 0]
[1 1 0]
[5 1 0 1]
[1 1 1 0 1]
[5 0 0 1 0 1]
[1 1 1 0 0 1 0]
[2 0 0 0 1 1 0 1]
[0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0]
[2 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0]
[3 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1]
[0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0]
```

There are n rows, the i<sup>th</sup> row has i elements and describes the i<sup>th</sup>
layer. Please notice that layer 0 is the input and is not included in this definition.

In each row, the first integer ranges from 0 to m-1 and indicates the operation in this layer.
Starting from the second position, the k<sup>th</sup> integer is a boolean value that indicates
whether (k-2)<sup>th</sup> layer has a skip connection with this layer.
(There will always be a connection from (k-1)<sup>th</sup> layer to k<sup>th</sup> layer)

#### Output of `GetSuggestion()`

The output of `GetSuggestion()` from the algorithm service consists of two parts:
`architecture` and `nn_config`.

`architecture` is a json string of the definition of a neural architecture. The format is as stated
above. One example is:

```
[[27], [29, 0], [22, 1, 0], [13, 0, 0, 0], [26, 1, 1, 0, 0], [30, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [11, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [9, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]]
```

`nn_config` is a json string of the detailed description of what is the num of layers,
input size, output size and what each operation index stands for. A `nn_config` corresponding to
the architecture above can be:

```
{
    "num_layers": 8,
    "input_sizes": [32, 32, 3],
    "output_sizes": [10],
    "embedding": {
        "27": {
            "opt_id": 27,
            "opt_type": "convolution",
            "opt_params": {
                "filter_size": "7",
                "num_filter": "96",
                "stride": "2"
            }
        },
        "29": {
            "opt_id": 29,
            "opt_type": "convolution",
            "opt_params": {
                "filter_size": "7",
                "num_filter": "128",
                "stride": "2"
            }
        },
        "22": {
            "opt_id": 22,
            "opt_type": "convolution",
            "opt_params": {
                "filter_size": "7",
                "num_filter": "48",
                "stride": "1"
            }
        },
        "13": {
            "opt_id": 13,
            "opt_type": "convolution",
            "opt_params": {
                "filter_size": "5",
                "num_filter": "48",
                "stride": "2"
            }
        },
        "26": {
            "opt_id": 26,
            "opt_type": "convolution",
            "opt_params": {
                "filter_size": "7",
                "num_filter": "96",
                "stride": "1"
            }
        },
        "30": {
            "opt_id": 30,
            "opt_type": "reduction",
            "opt_params": {
                "reduction_type": "max_pooling",
                "pool_size": 2
            }
        },
        "11": {
            "opt_id": 11,
            "opt_type": "convolution",
            "opt_params": {
                "filter_size": "5",
                "num_filter": "32",
                "stride": "2"
            }
        },
        "9": {
            "opt_id": 9,
            "opt_type": "convolution",
            "opt_params": {
                "filter_size": "3",
                "num_filter": "128",
                "stride": "2"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This neural architecture can be visualized as:

  alt="Example of NAS network"
  class="mt-3 mb-3">

The following items can be implemented in Katib to better support ENAS:

1. Add 'micro' mode, which means searching for a neural cell instead of the whole neural network.
1. Add support for recurrent neural networks and build a training container for the Penn Treebank task.
1. Add parameter sharing, if possible.
1. Change LSTM cell from self defined functions in LSTM.py to `tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell`
1. Store the Suggestion checkpoint to PVC to protect against unexpected enas service pod restarts
1. Add `RequestCount` into API so that the Suggestion can clean the information of completed studies.

## Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS)

The algorithm follows the idea proposed in _DARTS: Differentiable Architecture Search_ by Hanxiao Liu,
Karen Simonyan, Yiming Yang: https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09055.
The implementation is based on [official github implementation](https://github.com/quark0/darts) and
[popular repository](https://github.com/khanrc/pt.darts).

The algorithm addresses the scalability challenge of architecture search by formulating the task in
a differentiable manner. It is based on continuous relaxation and gradient descent in the search space.
It is able to efficiently design high-performance convolutional architectures for image classification
(on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet) and recurrent architectures for language modeling (on Penn Treebank and WikiText-2).

### Katib Implementation

To support DARTS in current Katib functionality the implementation follows this way:

1. [DARTS Suggestion service](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/blob/ea46a7f2b73b2d316b6b7619f99eb440ede1909b/pkg/suggestion/v1beta1/nas/darts/service.py)
   creates set of primitive operations from the Experiment search space.
   For example:

   ```
   ['separable_convolution_3x3', 'dilated_convolution_3x3', 'dilated_convolution_5x5', 'avg_pooling_3x3', 'max_pooling_3x3', 'skip_connection']
   ```

1. Suggestion returns algorithm settings, number of layers and set of primitives to Katib Controller

1. Katib controller starts
   [DARTS training container](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/tree/ea46a7f2b73b2d316b6b7619f99eb440ede1909b/examples/v1beta1/trial-images/darts-cnn-cifar10)
   with the appropriate settings and all possible operations.

1. Training container runs DARTS algorithm.

1. Metrics collector saves Best Genotype from the training container log.

#### Best Genotype representation

Best Genotype is the best cell for each neural network layer. Cells are generated by DARTS algorithm.
Here is an example of the Best Genotype:

```
Genotype(
  normal=[
      [('max_pooling_3x3',0),('max_pooling_3x3',1)],
      [('max_pooling_3x3',0),('max_pooling_3x3',1)],
      [('max_pooling_3x3',0),('dilated_convolution_3x3',3)],
      [('max_pooling_3x3',0),('max_pooling_3x3',1)]
    ],
    normal_concat=range(2,6),
  reduce=[
      [('dilated_convolution_5x5',1),('separable_convolution_3x3',0)],
      [('max_pooling_3x3',2),('dilated_convolution_5x5',1)],
      [('dilated_convolution_5x5',3),('dilated_convolution_5x5',2)],
      [('dilated_convolution_5x5',3),('dilated_convolution_5x5',4)]
    ],
    reduce_concat=range(2,6)
)
```

In this example you can see 4 DARTS nodes with indexes: 2,3,4,5.

`reduce` parameter is the cells which located at the 1/3 and 2/3 of the total neural network layers.
They represent reduction cells in which all the operations adjacent to the input nodes are of stride two.

`normal` parameter is the cells which is located at the rest neural network layers.
They represent normal cell.

In CNN all reduce and normal intermediate nodes are concatenated and each node has 2 edges.

Each element in `normal` array is the node which has 2 edges. First element is the operation on
the edge and second element is the node index connection. Note that index 0 is the `C_{k-2}` node
and index 1 is the `C_{k-1}` node.

For example `[('max_pooling_3x3',0),('max_pooling_3x3',1)]` means that `C_{k-2}` node connects to
the first node with `max_pooling_3x3` operation (Max Pooling with filter size 3) and `C_{k-1}`
node connects to the first node with `max_pooling_3x3` operation.

`reduce` array follows the same way as `normal` array.

`normal_concat` and `reduce_concat` means concatenation between intermediate nodes.

Currently, it supports running only on single GPU and second-order approximation, which produced
better results than first-order.

The following items can be implemented in DARTS:

- Support multi GPU training. Add functionality to select GPU for training.

- Support DARTS in Katib UI.

- Think about better representation of Best Genotype.

- Add more dataset for CNN. Currently, it supports only CIFAR-10.

- Support RNN in addition to CNN.

- Support micro mode, which means searching for a particular neural network cell.
