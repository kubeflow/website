## Katib Experiment Lifecycle

When user creates an Experiment, Katib Experiment controller,
Suggestion controller and Trial controller is working together to achieve
hyperparameters tuning for user's Machine learning model. The Experiment
workflow looks as follows:

1. The Experiment is submitted to the Kubernetes API server. Katib
   Experiment mutating and validating webhook is called to set the default
   values for the Experiment and validate the CR separately.

1. The Experiment controller creates the Suggestion.

1. The Suggestion controller creates the algorithm deployment and service
   based on the new Suggestion.

1. When the Suggestion controller verifies that the algorithm service is
   ready, it calls the service to generate
   `spec.request - len(status.suggestions)` sets of hyperparameters and append
   them into `status.suggestions`.

1. The Experiment controller finds that Suggestion had been updated and
   generates each Trial for the each new hyperparameters set.

1. The Trial controller generates `Worker Job` based on the `runSpec`
   from the Trial with the new hyperparameters set.

1. The related job controller
   (Kubernetes batch Job, Kubeflow TFJob, Tekton Pipeline, etc.) generates
   Kubernetes Pods.

1. Katib Pod mutating webhook is called to inject the metrics collector sidecar
   container to the candidate Pods.

1. During the ML model container runs, the metrics collector container
   collects metrics from the injected pod and persists metrics to the Katib
   DB backend.

1. When the ML model training ends, the Trial controller updates status
   of the corresponding Trial.

1. When the Trial goes to end, the Experiment controller increases
   `request` field of the corresponding Suggestion if it is needed,
   then everything goes to `step 4` again.
   Of course, if the Trial meet one of `end` condition
   (exceeds `maxTrialCount`, `maxFailedTrialCount` or `goal`),
   the Experiment controller takes everything done.
