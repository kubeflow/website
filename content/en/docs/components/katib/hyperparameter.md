This guide shows how to get started with Katib and run a few examples using the
command line and the Katib user interface (UI) to perform hyperparameter tuning.

For an overview of the concepts around Katib and hyperparameter tuning, check the
[introduction to Katib](/docs/components/katib/overview/).

## Katib setup

Let's set up and configure Katib on your Kubernetes cluster with Kubeflow.

### Prerequisites

This is the minimal requirements to install Katib:

- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- `kubectl` >= 1.21

<a id="katib-install"></a>

### Installing Katib

You can skip this step if you have already installed Kubeflow. Your Kubeflow
deployment includes Katib.

To install Katib as part of Kubeflow, follow the
[Kubeflow installation guide](/docs/started/getting-started/).

If you want to install Katib separately from Kubeflow, or to get a later version
of Katib, you can use one of the following Katib installs. To install the specific
Katib release (e.g. `v0.11.1`), modify `ref=master` to `ref=v0.11.1`.

1. **Katib Standalone Installation**
   
   There are two ways to install Katib by standalone, 
   both of which do not require any additional setup on your Kubernetes cluster.

   1. **Basic Installation**

      Run the following command to deploy Katib with the main components
      (`katib-controller`, `katib-ui`, `katib-mysql`, `katib-db-manager`, and `katib-cert-generator`):

      ```shell
      kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubeflow/katib.git/manifests/v1beta1/installs/katib-standalone?ref=master"
      ```

   2. **Controller Leader Election Support**
    
      Run the following command to deploy Katib with Controller
      [Leader Election](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2016/01/simple-leader-election-with-kubernetes/):

      ```shell
      kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubeflow/katib.git/manifests/v1beta1/installs/katib-leader-election?ref=master"
      ```
      
      This installation is almost the same as `Basic Installation`,
      although you can make `katib-controller` Highly Available (HA) using leader election.
      If you plan to use Katib in an environment where high Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are required, 
      such as a production environment, consider choosing this installation.

2. **Katib Cert Manager Installation**

   Run the following command to deploy Katib with
   [Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/) requirement:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubeflow/katib.git/manifests/v1beta1/installs/katib-cert-manager?ref=master"
   ```

   This installation uses Cert Manager instead of `katib-cert-generator`
   to provision Katib webhooks certificates. You have to deploy Cert Manager on
   your Kubernetes cluster before deploying Katib using this installation.

3. **Katib External DB Installation**

   Run the following command to deploy Katib with custom Database (DB) backend:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubeflow/katib.git/manifests/v1beta1/installs/katib-external-db?ref=master"
   ```

   This installation allows to use custom MySQL DB instead of `katib-mysql`.
   You have to modify appropriate environment variables for `katib-db-manager` in the
   [`secrets.env`](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/blob/master/manifests/v1beta1/installs/katib-external-db/secrets.env)
   to point at your custom MySQL DB. Learn more about `katib-db-manager`
   environment variables in [this guide](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/katib/env-variables/#katib-db-manager).

4. **Katib on OpenShift**

   Run the following command to deploy Katib on [OpenShift](https://docs.openshift.com/) v4.4+:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubeflow/katib.git/manifests/v1beta1/installs/katib-openshift?ref=master"
   ```

   This installation uses OpenShift service controller instead of `katib-cert-generator`
   to provision Katib webhooks certificates.

Above installations deploy
[PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims)
for the Katib DB component.

Your Kubernetes cluster must have `StorageClass` for dynamic volume provisioning.
For more information, check the Kubernetes documentation on
[dynamic provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/).

If your cluster doesn't have dynamic volume provisioning, you must manually
deploy [PersistentVolume (PV)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistent-volumes)
to bind [PVC](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/blob/master/manifests/v1beta1/components/mysql/pvc.yaml)
for the Katib DB component.

### Katib components

Run the following command to verify that Katib components are running:

```shell
$ kubectl get pods -n kubeflow

NAME                                READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
katib-cert-generator-79g7d          0/1     Completed   0          79s
katib-controller-566595bdd8-8w7sx   1/1     Running     0          82s
katib-db-manager-57cd769cdb-vt7zs   1/1     Running     0          82s
katib-mysql-7894994f88-djp7m        1/1     Running     0          81s
katib-ui-5767cfccdc-v9fcs           1/1     Running     0          80s
```

- `katib-controller` - the controller to manage Katib Kubernetes CRDs
  ([`Experiment`](/docs/components/katib/overview/#experiment),
  [`Suggestion`](/docs/components/katib/overview/#suggestion),
  [`Trial`](/docs/components/katib/overview/#trial))

- `katib-ui` - the Katib user interface.

- `katib-db-manager` - the GRPC API server to control Katib DB interface.

- `katib-mysql` - the `mysql` DB backend to store Katib experiments metrics.

- (Optional) `katib-cert-generator` - the certificate generator for Katib
  standalone installation. Learn more about the cert generator in the
  [developer guide](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/blob/master/docs/developer-guide.md#katib-cert-generator)

## Accessing the Katib UI

You can use the Katib user interface (UI) to submit experiments and to monitor
your results. The Katib home page within Kubeflow looks like this:

<img src="/docs/components/katib/images/home-page.png"
  alt="The Katib home page within the Kubeflow UI"
  class="mt-3 mb-3 border border-info rounded">

If you installed Katib as part of Kubeflow, you can access the
Katib UI from the Kubeflow UI:

1. Open the Kubeflow UI. Check the guide to
   [accessing the central dashboard](/docs/components/central-dash/overview/).
1. Click **Katib** in the left-hand menu.

Alternatively, you can set port-forwarding for the Katib UI service:

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/katib-ui -n kubeflow 8080:80
```

Then you can access the Katib UI at this URL:

```shell
http://localhost:8080/katib/
```

Check [this guide](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/tree/master/pkg/ui/v1beta1)
if you want to contribute to Katib UI.

## Examples

This section introduces some examples that you can run to try Katib.

<a id="random-search"></a>

### Example using random search algorithm

You can create an experiment for Katib by defining the experiment in a YAML
configuration file. The YAML file defines the configurations for the experiment,
including the hyperparameter feasible space, optimization parameter,
optimization goal, suggestion algorithm, and so on.

This example uses the [YAML file for the
random search example](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/blob/master/examples/v1beta1/hp-tuning/random.yaml).

The random search algorithm example uses an MXNet neural network to train an image
classification model using the MNIST dataset. You can check training container source code
[here](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/tree/master/examples/v1beta1/trial-images/mxnet-mnist).
The experiment runs twelve training jobs with various hyperparameters and saves the results.

If you installed Katib as part of Kubeflow, you can't run experiments in the
Kubeflow namespace. Run the following commands to change namespace and launch
an experiment using the random search example:

1. Download the example:

   ```shell
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/katib/master/examples/v1beta1/hp-tuning/random.yaml --output random.yaml
   ```

1. Edit `random.yaml` and change the following line to use your Kubeflow
   user profile namespace (e.g. `kubeflow-user-example-com`):

   ```
   namespace: kubeflow
   ```

1. (Optional) **Note:** Katib's experiments don't work with
   [Istio sidecar injection](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/#automatic-sidecar-injection).
   If you are using Kubeflow with
   Istio, you have to disable sidecar injection. To do that, specify this annotation:
   `sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false"` in your experiment's trial template.

   For the provided random search example with Kubernetes
   [`Job`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/)
   trial template, annotation should be under
   [`.trialSpec.spec.template.metadata.annotations`](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/blob/master/examples/v1beta1/hp-tuning/random.yaml#L52).
   For the Kubeflow `TFJob` or other training operators check
   [here](/docs/components/training/tftraining/#what-is-tfjob)
   how to set the annotation.

1. Deploy the example:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f random.yaml
   ```

This example embeds the hyperparameters as arguments. You can embed
hyperparameters in another way (for example, using environment variables)
by using the template defined in the `trialTemplate.trialSpec` section of
the YAML file. The template uses the
[unstructured](https://godoc.org/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1/unstructured)
format and substitutes parameters from the `trialTemplate.trialParameters`.
Follow the [trial template guide](/docs/components/katib/trial-template/)
to know more about it.

This example randomly generates the following hyperparameters:

- `--lr`: Learning rate. Type: double.
- `--num-layers`: Number of layers in the neural network. Type: integer.
- `--optimizer`: Optimization method to change the neural network attributes.
  Type: categorical.

Check the experiment status:

```shell
kubectl -n kubeflow-user-example-com get experiment random -o yaml
```

The output of the above command should look similar to this:

```yaml

### TensorFlow example

If you installed Katib as part of Kubeflow, you can’t run experiments in the
Kubeflow namespace. Run the following commands to launch an experiment using
the Kubeflow's [TensorFlow training job operator](/docs/components/training/tftraining), `TFJob`:

1. Download `tfjob-mnist-with-summaries.yaml`:

   ```shell
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/katib/master/examples/v1beta1/kubeflow-training-operator/tfjob-mnist-with-summaries.yaml --output tfjob-mnist-with-summaries.yaml
   ```

1. Edit `tfjob-mnist-with-summaries.yaml` and change the following line to use your Kubeflow
   user profile namespace (e.g. `kubeflow-user-example-com`):

   ```
   namespace: kubeflow
   ```

1. (Optional) **Note:** Katib's experiments don't work with
   [Istio sidecar injection](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/#automatic-sidecar-injection).
   If you are using Kubeflow with
   Istio, you have to disable sidecar injection. To do that, specify this annotation:
   `sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false"` in your experiment's trial template.
   For the provided `TFJob` example check
   [here](/docs/components/training/tftraining/#what-is-tfjob)
   how to set the annotation.

1. Deploy the example:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f tfjob-mnist-with-summaries.yaml
   ```

1. You can check the status of the experiment:

   ```shell
   kubectl -n kubeflow-user-example-com get experiment tfjob-mnist-with-summaries -o yaml
   ```

Follow the steps as described for the _random search algorithm example_
[above](#view-ui) to obtain the results of the experiment in the Katib UI.

### PyTorch example

If you installed Katib as part of Kubeflow, you can’t run experiments in the
Kubeflow namespace. Run the following commands to launch an experiment
using Kubeflow's [PyTorch training job operator](/docs/components/training/pytorch), `PyTorchJob`:

1. Download `pytorchjob-mnist.yaml`:

   ```shell
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/katib/master/examples/v1beta1/kubeflow-training-operator/pytorchjob-mnist.yaml --output pytorchjob-mnist.yaml
   ```

1. Edit `pytorchjob-mnist.yaml` and change the following line to use your
   Kubeflow user profile namespace (e.g. `kubeflow-user-example-com`):

   ```
   namespace: kubeflow
   ```

1. (Optional) **Note:** Katib's experiments don't work with
   [Istio sidecar injection](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/#automatic-sidecar-injection).
   If you are using Kubeflow with
   Istio, you have to disable sidecar injection. To do that, specify this annotation:
   `sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false"` in your experiment's trial template.
   For the provided `PyTorchJob` example setting the annotation should be similar to
   [`TFJob`](/docs/components/training/tftraining/#what-is-tfjob)

1. Deploy the example:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f pytorchjob-mnist.yaml
   ```

1. You can check the status of the experiment:

   ```shell
   kubectl -n kubeflow-user-example-com describe experiment pytorchjob-mnist
   ```

Follow the steps as described for the _random search algorithm example_
[above](#view-ui) to get the results of the experiment in the Katib UI.
