This guide introduces the concepts of hyperparameter tuning, neural
architecture search, and the Katib system as a component of Kubeflow.

Katib is a Kubernetes-native project for automated machine learning (AutoML).
Katib supports hyperparameter tuning, early stopping and
neural architecture search (NAS).
Learn more about AutoML at [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/2018/07/16/auto-ml2/),
[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/automl),
[Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml#automl-in-azure-machine-learning) or
[Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-sagemaker-autopilot-fully-managed-automatic-machine-learning/).

Katib is the project which is agnostic to machine learning (ML) frameworks.
It can tune hyperparameters of applications written in any language
of the users' choice and natively supports many ML frameworks,
such as TensorFlow, MXNet, PyTorch, XGBoost, and others.

Katib supports a lot of various AutoML algorithms, such as
[Bayesian optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.2599.pdf),
[Tree of Parzen Estimators](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2011/file/86e8f7ab32cfd12577bc2619bc635690-Paper.pdf),
[Random Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization#Random_search),
[Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES),
[Hyperband](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06560.pdf),
[Efficient Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03268),
[Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09055)
and many more. Additional algorithm support is coming soon.

The [Katib project](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib) is open source.
The [developer guide](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/blob/master/docs/developer-guide.md)
is a good starting point for developers who want to contribute to the project.

## Hyperparameters and hyperparameter tuning

_Hyperparameters_ are the variables that control the model training process.
They include:

- The learning rate.
- The number of layers in a neural network.
- The number of nodes in each layer.

Hyperparameter values are not _learned_. In other words, in contrast to the
node weights and other training _parameters_, the model training process does
not adjust the hyperparameter values.

_Hyperparameter tuning_ is the process of optimizing the hyperparameter values
to maximize the predictive accuracy of the model. If you don't use Katib or a
similar system for hyperparameter tuning, you need to run many training jobs
yourself, manually adjusting the hyperparameters to find the optimal values.

Automated hyperparameter tuning works by optimizing a target variable,
also called the _objective metric_, that you specify in the configuration for
the hyperparameter tuning job. A common metric is the model's accuracy
in the validation pass of the training job (_validation-accuracy_). You also
specify whether you want the hyperparameter tuning job to _maximize_ or
_minimize_ the metric.

For example, the following graph from Katib shows the level of validation accuracy
for various combinations of hyperparameter values (the learning rate, the number of
layers, and the optimizer):

_(To run the example that produced this graph, follow the [getting-started
guide](/docs/components/katib/hyperparameter/).)_

Katib runs several training jobs (known as _trials_) within each
hyperparameter tuning job (_experiment_). Each trial tests a different set of
hyperparameter configurations. At the end of the experiment, Katib outputs
the optimized values for the hyperparameters.

You can improve you hyperparameter tunning experiments by using
[early stopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping) techniques.
Follow the [early stopping guide](/docs/components/katib/early-stopping/)
for the details.

## Neural architecture search

{{% alert title="Alpha version" color="warning" %}}
NAS is currently in <b>alpha</b> with limited support. The Kubeflow team is
interested in any feedback you may have, in particular with regards to usability
of the feature. You can log issues and comments in
the [Katib issue tracker](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/issues).
{{% /alert %}}

In addition to hyperparameter tuning, Katib offers a _neural architecture
search_ feature. You can use the NAS to design
your artificial neural network, with a goal of maximizing the predictive
accuracy and performance of your model.

NAS is closely related to hyperparameter tuning. Both are subsets of AutoML.
While hyperparameter tuning optimizes the model's hyperparameters, a NAS system
optimizes the model's structure, node weights and hyperparameters.

NAS technology in general uses various techniques to find the optimal neural
network design.

You can submit Katib jobs from the command line or from the UI. (Learn more
about the Katib interfaces later on this page.) The following screenshot shows
part of the form for submitting a NAS job from the Katib UI:

## Katib interfaces

You can use the following interfaces to interact with Katib:

- A web UI that you can use to submit experiments and to monitor your results.
  Check the [getting-started
  guide](/docs/components/katib/hyperparameter/#katib-ui)
  for information on how to access the UI.
  The Katib home page within Kubeflow looks like this:

  <img src="/docs/components/katib/images/home-page.png"
    alt="The Katib home page within the Kubeflow UI"
    class="mt-3 mb-3 border border-info rounded">

- A gRPC API. Check the [API reference](/docs/reference/katib/v1beta1/katib).

- Command-line interfaces (CLIs):

  - **kfctl** is the Kubeflow CLI that you can use to install and configure
    Kubeflow. Learn about kfctl in the guide to
    [configuring Kubeflow](/docs/other-guides/kustomize/).

  - The Kubernetes CLI, **kubectl**, is useful for running commands against your
    Kubeflow cluster. Learn about kubectl in the [Kubernetes
    documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

- Katib Python SDK. Check the [Katib Python SDK documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/tree/master/sdk/python/v1beta1).

## Katib concepts

This section describes the terms used in Katib.

### Experiment

An _experiment_ is a single tuning run, also called an optimization run.

You specify configuration settings to define the experiment. The following are
the main configurations:

- **Objective**: What you want to optimize. This is the objective metric, also
  called the target variable. A common metric is the model's accuracy
  in the validation pass of the training job (_validation-accuracy_). You also
  specify whether you want the hyperparameter tuning job to _maximize_ or
  _minimize_ the metric.

- **Search space**: The set of all possible hyperparameter values that the
  hyperparameter tuning job should consider for optimization, and the
  constraints for each hyperparameter. Other names for search space include
  _feasible set_ and _solution space_. For example, you may provide the
  names of the hyperparameters that you want to optimize. For each
  hyperparameter, you may provide a _minimum_ and _maximum_ value or a _list_
  of allowable values.

- **Search algorithm**: The algorithm to use when searching for the optimal
  hyperparameter values.

For details of how to define your experiment, follow the guide to [running an
experiment](/docs/components/katib/experiment/).

### Suggestion

A _suggestion_ is a set of hyperparameter values that the hyperparameter
tuning process has proposed. Katib creates a trial to evaluate the suggested
set of values.

### Trial

A _trial_ is one iteration of the hyperparameter tuning process. A trial
corresponds to one worker job instance with a list of parameter assignments.
The list of parameter assignments corresponds to a suggestion.

Each experiment runs several trials. The experiment runs the trials until it
reaches either the objective or the configured maximum number of trials.

### Worker job

The _worker job_ is the process that runs to evaluate a trial and calculate
its objective value.

The worker job can be any type of Kubernetes resource or
[Kubernetes CRD](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/).
Follow the
[trial template guide](/docs/components/katib/trial-template/#custom-resource)
to check how to support your own Kubernetes resource in Katib.

Katib has these CRD examples in upstream:

- [Kubernetes `Job`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/)

- [Kubeflow `TFJob`](/docs/components/training/tftraining/)

- [Kubeflow `PyTorchJob`](/docs/components/training/pytorch/)

- [Kubeflow `MPIJob`](/docs/components/training/mpi)

- [Tekton `Pipeline`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline)

By offering the above worker job types, Katib supports multiple ML frameworks.

## Next steps
