## What is the Kubeflow Central Dashboard?

The _Kubeflow Central Dashboard_ provides an authenticated web interface for Kubeflow and ecosystem components. 
It acts as a hub for your machine learning platform and tools by exposing the UIs of components running in the cluster.

Some core features of the central dashboard include:

- Authentication and authorization based on [Profiles and Namespaces](/docs/components/central-dash/profiles/).
- Access to the [user interface's](#navigation) of Kubeflow components.
- The ability to [customize and include links](/docs/components/central-dash/customizing-menu/) to third-party applications.
