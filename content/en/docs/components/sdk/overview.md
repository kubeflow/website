## What is Kubeflow SDK?

The Kubeflow SDK is a set of unified Pythonic APIs that let you run any AI workload at any scale – without the need to learn Kubernetes. It provides simple and consistent APIs across the Kubeflow ecosystem, enabling users to focus on building AI applications rather than managing complex infrastructure.

Kubeflow SDK Benefits

- Unified Experience: Single SDK to interact with multiple Kubeflow projects through consistent Python APIs
- Simplified AI Workloads: Abstract away Kubernetes complexity and work effortlessly across all Kubeflow projects using familiar Python APIs
- Built for Scale: Seamlessly scale any AI workload — from local laptop to large-scale production cluster with thousands of GPUs using the same APIs.
- Rapid Iteration: Reduced friction between development and production environments
- Local Development: First-class support for local development without a Kubernetes cluster requiring only pip installation
