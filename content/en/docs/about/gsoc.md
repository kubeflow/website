## Information for students

The GSoC student application phase is now closed and student selection is in
progress. See the 
[GSoC timeline](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline).

You're still welcome to explore Kubeflow. Kubeflow welcomes contributions
at any time, whether within or outside the framework of GSoC. See the 
[community page](/docs/about/community/) for Slack channels, mailing lists, 
meetings, and other ways to connect with the Kubeflow community.

For more information about GSoC, see the

## Information for mentors

Thanks to all mentors who're interested in helping a GSoC student with their
Kubeflow project. 

To get started:

* Read the [Google Summer of Code mentor 
  guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/) and the [roles and 
  responsibilities](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/responsibilities) 
  to understand what is expected of you over the next 6 months.
* Bookmark the 
  [GSoC timeline](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline)
  and be prepared to take action in time for the milestones shown on the
  timeline, and to help your students meet the deadlines.
* Watch the 5 minute YouTube video: [Being a Great GSoC 
  Mentor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J_eBuYxcyg). The video was shot with
  GSoC veteran org admins and mentors. It contains helpful information about the
  program and how to participate successfully at each step in GSoC.
* If you're not registered as a mentor, email
  [kubeflow-gsoc-admin@kubeflow.org](mailto:kubeflow-gsoc-admin@kubeflow.org) 
  to indicate your interest in mentoring a student during GSoC.
* When you receive an invitation, follow the link in the email to register on the
  GSoC program site.
* Examine the student proposals. Click **want to mentor** on the proposals
  that you'd like to mentor.

Start chatting to students:

* Join the 
  [#gsoc](https://kubeflow.slack.com/messages/CUF1GCJ4Q) channel on Kubeflow
  Slack and answer students' questions.
* Respond to students' questions on the Kubeflow mentors mailing list
  (`kubeflow-gsoc-mentors@kubeflow.org`).

For more information about GSoC, see the 
[GSoC docs](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq) and
