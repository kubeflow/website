## Welcome to all Google Summer of Code (GSoC) participants

The Kubeflow community is delighted to be part of 
**Google Summer of Code 2020**. Community
mentors look forward to working with students on their GSoC projects.

[Visit the Kubeflow GSoC page](/docs/about/gsoc/) to find handy information and
links for GSoC students and mentors.

## Community discussions

There are many ways to contribute! Join one of our communication channels, 
attend a community meeting, get to know the community, discuss updates, suggest
exciting new integrations.

### Community meetings

If your group has a regular meeting, talk to
[@ewilderj](https://github.com/ewilderj) about getting it added to the calendar.

### Kubeflow community call

The project team holds a weekly community call on Tuesdays. This call alternates
weekly between US East/EMEA and US West/APAC friendly times. Joining the
[kubeflow-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubeflow-discuss)
mailing list will automatically send you calendar invitations for the meetings, 
or you can subscribe to the community meeting calendar above.

Agenda, notes, and a reminder of the next call are sent to the kubeflow-discuss
mailing list.
