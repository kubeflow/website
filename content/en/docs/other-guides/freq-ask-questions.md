### Is deploying Kubeflow with Helm supported?

No, Kubeflow only provides Kustomize packages for Kubeflow applications. So deploying Kubeflow isn't supported except via Kustomize.

Kubeflow makes use of [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) to help customize Kubeflow for different platforms and configurations.

However, once you deploy Kubeflow you can express Kubernetes resources using YAML, Kustomize, Helm or whatever tool you like.
