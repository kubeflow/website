This page describes the Kubeflow resources and support options that you can
explore when you encounter a problem, have a question, or want to make a
suggestion about Kubeflow.

## Levels of support

Kubeflow applications offer various levels of support, based on the application
status. To see the status of each application, refer to the 
[Kubeflow application 
matrix](/docs/reference/version-policy/#kubeflow-application-matrix) on the
version policies page.

The following table describes the level of support that you can expect based on
the status of an application:

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead class="thead-light">
      <tr>
        <th>Application status</th>
        <th>Level of support</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Stable</td>
        <td>The Kubeflow community offers <i>best-effort support</i> for stable
          applications. See the section on 
          <a href="#community-support">community support</a> below for a
          definition of best-effort support and the community channels where you 
          can report and discuss the problem. You can also consider requesting 
          support from a 
          <a href="#provider-support">Kubeflow community provider</a> or from 
          your <a href="#cloud-support">cloud provider</a>.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Beta</td>
        <td>The Kubeflow community offers <i>best-effort support</i> for beta
          applications. See the section on 
          <a href="#community-support">community support</a> below for a
          definition of best-effort support and the community channels where you 
          can report and discuss the problem. 
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Alpha</td>
        <td>The response differs per application in alpha status, depending on
          the size of the community for that application and the current level
          of active development of the application.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

## Support from the Kubeflow community

Kubeflow has an active and helpful community of users and contributors. 

The Kubeflow community offers support on a best-effort basis for stable and beta
applications.
**Best-effort support** means that there's no formal agreement or
commitment to solve a problem but the community appreciates the
importance of addressing the problem as soon as possible. The community commits
to helping you diagnose and address the problem if all the following are true:

* The cause falls within the technical framework that Kubeflow controls. For
  example, the Kubeflow community may not be able to help if the problem is 
  caused by a specific network configuration within your organization.
* Community members can reproduce the problem.
* The reporter of the problem can help with further diagnosis and 
  troubleshooting.

You can ask questions and make suggestions in the following places:

* **Slack** for online chat and messaging. See details of Kubeflow's 
  [Slack workspace and channels](/docs/about/community/#slack).
* **Kubeflow discuss** for email-based group discussion. Join the
  [kubeflow-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubeflow-discuss) 
  group.
* **Kubeflow documentation** for overviews and how-to guides. In particular,
  refer to the following documents when troubleshooting a problem:

  * [Kubeflow installation and setup](/docs/started/getting-started/)
  * [Kubeflow components](/docs/components/)
  * [Further setup and troubleshooting](/docs/other-guides/)

* **Kubeflow issue trackers** for known issues, questions, and feature requests.
  Search the open issues to see if someone else has already logged the problem 
  that you're encountering and learn about any workarounds to date. If no one
  has logged your problem, create a new issue to describe the problem.

    Each Kubeflow application has its own issue tracker within the [Kubeflow
    organization on GitHub](https://github.com/kubeflow). To get you started,
    here are the primary issue trackers:

  * [Kubeflow core](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues)
  * [kfctl command-line tool](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/issues)
  * [Kustomize manifests](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/issues)
  * [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/issues)
  * [Katib hyperparameter tuning](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/issues)
  * [Metadata](https://github.com/kubeflow/metadata/issues)
  * [Fairing notebook SDK](https://github.com/kubeflow/fairing/issues)
  * [TensorFlow training (TFJob)](https://github.com/kubeflow/tf-operator/issues)
  * [PyTorch training (PyTorchJob)](https://github.com/kubeflow/pytorch-operator/issues)
  * [KFServing](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving/issues)
  * [Examples](https://github.com/kubeflow/examples/issues)
  * [Documentation](https://github.com/kubeflow/website/issues)
