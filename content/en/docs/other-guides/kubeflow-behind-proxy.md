## Install Kubeflow behind a proxy server

This guide demonstrates how to install and configure Kubeflow behind a proxy server.

**Note**: These instructions assume that your Docker setup has a [configured
proxy service](https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/) on each Kubernetes node.

1. Create an alias for the proxy:

```shell
alias https='https_proxy=https://{SERVER}:{PORT}'
```

where `{SERVER}` is the IP address of your proxy server and `{PORT}` is the port number.

2. Download the latest [kfctl](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl) â€” the control
   pane for deploying and managing Kubeflow from the [Kubeflow
   releases](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/releases/) page. For example, run
   the command below to download the zipped kfctl TAR file for Kubeflow v1.1 and
   extract it to `/usr/local/bin`:

```shell
https wget https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/releases/download/v1.1.0/kfctl_v1.1.0-0-g9a3621e_linux.tar.gz extract to /usr/local/bin
```

3. To install Kubeflow on an existing cluster, you need to download the the
   latest configuration YAML file. For example, for Kubeflow v1.1 it is:

```
https wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/v1.1-branch/kfdef/kfctl_istio_dex.v1.1.0.yaml
```

4. Download the KfDef manifest zipped TAR file. For example, for Kubeflow v1.1
   you should run the following command:

```shell
https wget https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/archive/v1.1-branch.tar.gz
```

5. Open the YAML configuration (zipped) file and under `- name: manifests`
   change the old URI (such as
   `https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/archive/v1.1-branch.tar.gz`) to the
   location of the new one as follows:

```shell
- name: manifests
  uri: {ABSOLUTE_PATH}/v1.1-branch.tar.gz
```

where `{ABSOLUTE_PATH}` is your path to the the manifest.

6. Run `kfctl build` to create configuration files before Kubeflow deployment:

```shell
kfctl build -V -f kfctl_k8s_istio.yaml
```

7. Deploy Kubeflow:

```shell
kfctl apply -V -f kfctl_k8s_istio.yaml
```
