This guide describes how to use the `kfctl` CLI to deploy Kubeflow 1.0 on an existing OpenShift 4.x cluster.

## Prerequisites

### OpenShift 4 cluster

* You need to have access to an OpenShift 4 cluster as `cluster-admin` to be able to deploy Kubeflow.
* You can use [Code Ready Containers](https://code-ready.github.io/crc/) (CRC) to run a local cluster, use [try.openshift.com](https://try.openshift.com) to create a new cluster or use an existing cluster.
* Install [`oc` command-line tool](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html) to communicate with the cluster.

#### Code Ready Containers

If you are using Code Ready Containers, you need to make sure you have enough resources configured for the VM:

Recommended: 

```
16 GB memory
6 CPU
45 GB disk space
```

Minimal:

```
10 GB memory
6 CPU
30 GB disk space (default for CRC)
```

## Installing Kubeflow

Use the following steps to install Kubeflow 1.0 on OpenShift 4.x.

1. Clone the [opendatahub/manifests]
(https://github.com/opendatahub-io/manifests) repository. This repository defaults to the `v1.0-branch-openshift` branch.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/opendatahub-io/manifests.git
    cd manifests
    ```

1. Build the deployment configuration using the OpenShift KFDef file and local downloaded manifests.

    > Update the manifest repo URI. Copy the KFDef file to the Kubeflow application directory. And finally build the configuration.

    ```
    # update the manifest repo URI
    sed -i 's#uri: .*#uri: '$PWD'#' ./kfdef/kfctl_openshift.yaml

    # set the Kubeflow application diretory for this deployment, for example /opt/openshift-kfdef
    export KF_DIR=<path-to-kfdef>
    mkdir -p ${KF_DIR}
    cp ./kfdef/kfctl_openshift.yaml ${KF_DIR}
    
    # build deployment configuration
    cd ${KF_DIR}
    kfctl build --file=kfctl_openshift.yaml
    ```

1. Apply the generated deployment configuration.

    ```
    kfctl apply --file=kfctl_openshift.yaml
    ```

1. Wait until all the pods are running.

    ```
    $ oc get pods -n kubeflow

1. The command below looks up the URL of Kubeflow user interface assigned by the OpenShift cluster. You can open the printed URL in your broser to access the Kubeflow user interface.

    ```
    oc get routes -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='http://{.spec.host}/'
    ```
