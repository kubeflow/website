Elyra aims to help data scientists, machine learning engineers and AI developers
through the model development life cycle complexities. Elyra integrates with JupyterLab
providing a Pipeline visual editor that enables low code/no code creation of Pipelines
that can be executed in a Kubeflow environment.

Below is an example of a Piepline created with Elyra, you can identify the components/tasks
and related properties that are all managed in the visual editor.
