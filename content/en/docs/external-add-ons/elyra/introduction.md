## What is Elyra?

Elyra aims to help data scientists, machine learning engineers and AI developers through the model development life cycle complexities. 
Elyra integrates with JupyterLab providing a Pipeline visual editor that enables low code/no code creation of Pipelines that can be executed in a Kubeflow environment.

### Elyra Pipeline Visual Editor

Elyra provides a visual editor that enables you to create Kubeflow Pipelines using a drag and drop interface.

Below is an example of a Pipeline created with Elyra, you can identify the components/tasks and related properties that are all managed in the visual editor.
