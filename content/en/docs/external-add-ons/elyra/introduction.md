## What is Elyra?

[Elyra](https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is an [open-source](https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra) tool to reduce model development life cycle complexities. 
Elyra is a _JupyterLab extension_ that provides a _visual pipeline editor_ to enable low-code creation of pipelines that can be executed with Kubeflow Pipelines.

The following screenshot shows an example of a Pipeline created with Elyra:

## How to use Elyra with Kubeflow?

Elyra can be used with Kubeflow to create and run Pipelines in a Kubeflow environment.

You may create a [custom Kubeflow Notebook image](/docs/components/notebooks/container-images/#custom-images) based on any of our pre-built Jupyter Notebook images and install Elyra in it.
The Elyra project has an [example in their documentation](https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/stable/recipes/using-elyra-with-kubeflow-notebook-server.html) and a [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra/blob/main/etc/docker/kubeflow/Dockerfile) that you can use as a reference.

Elyra [`3.15.0`](https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra/releases/tag/v3.15.0) may not properly support JupyterLab 4.0, which has been included in the default Kubeflow Notebook images since Kubeflow 1.9.0.
