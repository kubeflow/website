# Powering GenAI Use Cases with Kubeflow

Kubeflow Projects are powered every stage of GenAI application lifecycle.

From generating synthetic data to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), hyperparameter optimization, inference at scale, and evaluation,
Kubeflow’s modular, Kubernetes-native architecture makes building end-to-end GenAI pipelines both reproducible and production-ready.

## Synthetic Data Generation

When real data is scarce or sensitive, Kubeflow Pipelines automates the creation of high-fidelity synthetic datasets using techniques like [GANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network), [VAEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_autoencoder), and [statistical copulas](https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2020-427/gmd-2020-427.pdf). By defining parameterized pipeline components that:

- Train synthesizer models  
- Validate synthetic output against privacy/fidelity criteria  
- Parallelize jobs across on-prem or cloud clusters  

teams can accelerate experimentation without compromising compliance. Learn more in the [Synthetic Data Generation with KFP guide](https://blog.kubeflow.org/kfp/2025/02/16/synthetic-data-using-kfp.html).

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG combines vector-based retrieval with generative models to produce contextually grounded outputs:

1. **Indexing & Storage**  
   - Ingest document embeddings into Feast’s vector store (e.g., Milvus)  
2. **Retrieval at Inference**  
   - Fetch top-k relevant chunks via Feast → Milvus  
   - Concatenate retrieved context into the LLM prompt  
3. **Tuning Retrieval Parameters**  
   - Use Katib to sweep over `top_k`, `temperature`, etc., and optimize metrics like BLEU  

This workflow is detailed in the [Katib RAG blog post](https://blog.kubeflow.org/katib/rag/) and the [Feast + Docling RAG tutorial](https://docs.feast.dev/tutorials/rag-with-docling).

## Scaling RAG Data Transformation with Spark

Preprocessing massive document collections for RAG pipelines—text cleaning, chunking, and embedding generation—can become a bottleneck. Kubeflow integrates with the [Spark Operator](/docs/components/spark-operator/overview/) to run distributed Spark jobs on Kubernetes, allowing you to:

- Ingest & Process Raw Documents: Read text files or PDFs from cloud storage (S3, GCS) or databases.
- Text Chunking: Normalize, tokenize, and split content into fixed-size passages with overlap.
- Distributed Embedding: Call embedding services (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace) inside Spark UDFs or map operations to parallelize across executor pods.
- Direct Write to Feature Store: Persist chunk embeddings and metadata back into Feast’s offline store or vector store without intermediate bottlenecks.

## Fine-Tuning LLMs

Check out our [latest Fine-Tuning](https://github.com/kubeflow/trainer/blob/master/examples/deepspeed/text-summarization/T5-Fine-Tuning.ipynb) example with DeepSpeed and the Kubeflow Trainer v2!

Domain-specific fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs is streamlined by the [Kubeflow Training Operator’s legacy Trainer API](docs/components/trainer/legacy-v1/user-guides/fine-tuning/):

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1
kind: PyTorchJob
metadata:
  name: llm-fine-tune
spec:
  pytorchReplicaSpecs:
    Worker:
      replicas: 4
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: pytorch
            image: your-registry/llm-trainer:latest
            command: ["python", "train.py", "--dataset", "/data/train"]
            env:
            - name: MODEL_URI
              value: gs://models/your-llm
```
You can also invoke fine-tuning programmatically:


```python
from kubeflow.training import TrainingClient

client = TrainingClient()
client.train(
    model_uri="gs://models/your-llm",
    dataset_uri="gs://datasets/domain-data",
    trainer="pytorch",
    worker_replicas=4,
    lora_config={"rank": 8, "alpha": 32}
)
```
For details, see the [Kubeflow Trainer fine-tuning guide](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/trainer/legacy-v1/user-guides/fine-tuning/).

## Hyperparameter Optimization
Automated tuning is essential to maximize model performance:

Katib Experiments let you define hyperparameter search spaces and optimization objectives (e.g., minimize loss, maximize BLEU).

Katib allows you to effortlessly [optimize hyperparameters of LLMs using distributed PyTorchJobs](https://blog.kubeflow.org/gsoc-2024-project-4/).

## Inference at Scale
After training and tuning, [KServe](docs/external-add-ons/kserve/introduction) delivers scalable, framework-agnostic inference:

- Expose models via Kubernetes Custom Resources

- Automate blue/green or canary rollouts

- Autoscale based on real-time metrics (CPU, GPU, request latency)

Integrate KServe endpoints into Pipelines to orchestrate rollout strategies and ensure consistent low-latency GenAI services.


## Model Evaluation
Rigorous evaluation guards against drift and degradation:

- Pipeline-Embedded Eval Steps
    - Statistical benchmarks for synthetic data
    - Text metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) for generation quality

- [Early-Stopping & Tuning](docs/components/katib/user-guides/early-stopping/)
    - Leverage Katib’s metric collector to enforce early-stop rules
    - Close the loop: evaluation → tuning → retrain

By codifying evaluation in Pipelines, you maintain reproducibility and versioned lineage from data to model to metrics.


## Beyond Core Use Cases
Kubeflow’s ecosystem continues to expand:

- Notebooks UI for interactive development (Jupyter, VSCode)

- Model Registry for artifact versioning & lineage

- Spark & Batch Operators for data-intensive preprocessing

- Feast [supports vector similarity search](https://docs.feast.dev/tutorials/rag-with-docling) for RAG and other next-gen AI workloads

- Each Kubeflow Project plugs seamlessly into Kubernetes, ensuring portability and consistency.
