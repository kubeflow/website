# Powering GenAI Use Cases with Kubeflow


Kubeflow Projects are powering every stage of the GenAI application lifecycle


From generating synthetic data to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), hyperparameter optimization, inference at scale, and evaluation,
Kubeflow’s modular, Kubernetes-native architecture makes building end-to-end GenAI pipelines both reproducible and production-ready.

## Synthetic Data Generation

When real data is scarce or sensitive, Kubeflow Pipelines automates the creation of high-fidelity synthetic datasets using techniques like [GANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network), [VAEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_autoencoder), and [statistical copulas](https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2020-427/gmd-2020-427.pdf). By defining parameterized pipeline components that:

- Train synthesizer models
- Validate synthetic output against privacy/fidelity criteria
- Parallelize jobs across on-prem or cloud clusters

teams can accelerate experimentation without compromising compliance. Learn more in the [Synthetic Data Generation with KFP guide](https://blog.kubeflow.org/kfp/2025/02/16/synthetic-data-using-kfp.html).

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG combines vector-based retrieval with generative models to produce contextually grounded outputs:

1. **Indexing & Storage**
   - Ingest document embeddings into Feast’s vector store (e.g., Milvus)
2. **Retrieval at Inference**
   - Fetch top-k relevant chunks via Feast → Milvus
   - Concatenate retrieved context into the LLM prompt
3. **Tuning Retrieval Parameters**
   - Use Katib to sweep over `top_k`, `temperature`, etc., and optimize metrics like BLEU

This workflow is detailed in the [Katib RAG blog post](https://blog.kubeflow.org/katib/rag/) and the [Feast + Docling RAG tutorial](https://docs.feast.dev/tutorials/rag-with-docling).

## Scaling RAG Data Transformation with Spark

Preprocessing massive document collections for RAG pipelines—text cleaning, chunking, and embedding generation—can become a bottleneck. Kubeflow integrates with the [Spark Operator](/docs/components/spark-operator/overview/) to run distributed Spark jobs on Kubernetes, allowing you to:

- Ingest & Process Raw Documents: Read text files or PDFs from cloud storage (S3, GCS) or databases.
- Text Chunking: Normalize, tokenize, and split content into fixed-size passages with overlap.
- Distributed Embedding: Call embedding services (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace) inside Spark UDFs or map operations to parallelize across executor pods.
- Direct Write to Feature Store: Persist chunk embeddings and metadata back into Feast’s offline store or vector store without intermediate bottlenecks.

## Fine-Tuning LLMs

Kubeflow Trainer provides a seamless way to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) at scale using
popular frameworks such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/),
[MLX](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx), and others.

With [the Kubeflow SDK](https://github.com/kubeflow/sdk) and the `train()` API, you can define
custom fine-tuning scripts and scale them across thousands of GPUs. For detailed usage, see
the Kubeflow Trainer documentation:

- [PyTorch: Qwen3-32B fine-tuning](/docs/components/trainer/user-guides/pytorch/#configure-pytorch-training-function).
- [DeepSpeed: T5 fine-tuning](/docs/components/trainer/user-guides/deepspeed/#configure-deepspeed-training-function).
- [MLX: LLama3.2 fine-tuning](/docs/components/trainer/user-guides/mlx/#fine-tune-llm-with-mlx-and-trainjob)

You can implement a wide range of advanced algorithms to fine-tune your LLMs such as
supervised fine tuning (SFT), knowledge distillation, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
quantization-aware training, and more.

Kubeflow Trainer enables efficient distributed training with both data parallelism and
model parallelism, ensuring optimal GPU utilization and reduced training time.

For a faster start, you can use
[the `BuiltinTrainers()`](/docs/components/trainer/user-guides/builtin-trainer/overview/), which
provide pre-configured blueprints for LLMs fine-tuning.
Simply specify the desired configuration to get started:

```python
from kubeflow.trainer import (
    TrainerClient,
    Initializer,
    HuggingFaceModelInitializer,
    BuiltinTrainer,
    TorchTuneConfig,
    TorchTuneInstructDataset,
    DataFormat,
    DataType,
)

TrainerClient().train(
    runtime=TrainerClient().get_runtime("torchtune-llama3.2-1b"),
    initializer=Initializer(
        model=HuggingFaceModelInitializer(
            storage_uri="hf://meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct",
            access_token="<YOUR_HF_TOKEN>",  # Replace with your Hugging Face token
        )
    ),
    trainer=BuiltinTrainer(
        config=TorchTuneConfig(
            dataset_preprocess_config=TorchTuneInstructDataset(
                source=DataFormat.PARQUET,
                split="train[:1000]",
                new_system_prompt="You are an AI assistant. ",
            ),
            epochs=10,
            dtype=DataType.BF16,
            resources_per_node={
                "memory": "200G",
                "gpu": 4,
            },
        )
    ),
)
```

For details, see the [Kubeflow Trainer TorchTune guide](/docs/components/trainer/user-guides/builtin-trainer/torchtune/).

## Hyperparameter Optimization

Automated tuning is essential to maximize model performance:

Katib Experiments let you define hyperparameter search spaces and optimization objectives (e.g., minimize loss, maximize BLEU).

Katib allows you to effortlessly [optimize hyperparameters of LLMs using distributed PyTorchJobs](https://blog.kubeflow.org/gsoc-2024-project-4/).

## Inference at Scale

After training and tuning, [KServe](/docs/components/kserve/introduction) delivers scalable, framework-agnostic inference:

- Expose models via Kubernetes Custom Resources

- Automate blue/green or canary rollouts

- Autoscale based on real-time metrics (CPU, GPU, request latency)

Integrate KServe endpoints into Pipelines to orchestrate rollout strategies and ensure consistent low-latency GenAI services.

## Model Evaluation

Rigorous evaluation guards against drift and degradation:

- Pipeline-Embedded Eval Steps

  - Statistical benchmarks for synthetic data
  - Text metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) for generation quality

- [Early-Stopping & Tuning](docs/components/katib/user-guides/early-stopping/)
  - Leverage Katib’s metric collector to enforce early-stop rules
  - Close the loop: evaluation → tuning → retrain

By codifying evaluation in Pipelines, you maintain reproducibility and versioned lineage from data to model to metrics.

## Beyond Core Use Cases

Kubeflow’s ecosystem continues to expand:

- Notebooks UI for interactive development (Jupyter, VSCode)

- Model Registry for artifact versioning & lineage

- Spark & Batch Operators for data-intensive preprocessing

- Feast [supports vector similarity search](https://docs.feast.dev/tutorials/rag-with-docling) for RAG and other next-gen AI workloads

- Each Kubeflow Project plugs seamlessly into Kubernetes, ensuring portability and consistency.
