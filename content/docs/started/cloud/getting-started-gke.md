For details on setting up your GCP
environment and deploying Kubeflow on Kubernetes Engine (GKE),
refer to the [deployment section](/docs/gke/deploy/) of the
[Kubeflow GCP documentation](/docs/gke/).

Alternatively, view the following walk-through which demonstrates how to install Kubeflow on GCP using
both the UI and CLI. All code used in this video can be found in the
[examples
