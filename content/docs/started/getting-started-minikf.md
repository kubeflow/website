A production-ready, full-fledged, local Kubeflow deployment that
installs in minutes.

MiniKF is a fast and easy way to get started with Kubeflow. With just a
few clicks, you are up for experimentation, and for running complete
Kubeflow Pipelines.

To train at scale, move to a Kubeflow cloud deployment with one click,
without having to rewrite anything.

Please see the [official
announcement](https://medium.com/kubeflow/minikf-the-fastest-and-easiest-way-to-deploy-kubeflow-on-your-laptop-a91fb846d0ba)
and the rationale behind MiniKF.
