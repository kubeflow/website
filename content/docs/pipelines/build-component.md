This page is for advanced users. It describes how to build your own pipeline 
components. For an easier start, try 
[building a pipeline with the provided samples](/docs/guides/pipelines/build-pipeline).

## Overview of pipeline components

Kubeflow Pipelines components are implementations of pipeline tasks. Each task 
takes one or more 
[artifacts](/docs/guides/pipelines/pipelines-concepts#step-output-artifacts) as
input and may produce one or more
[artifacts](/docs/guides/pipelines/pipelines-concepts#step-output-artifacts) as 
output.

Each task usually includes two parts:

``Client code``
  The code that talks to endpoints to submit jobs. For example, code to talk to 
  the Google Dataproc API to submit a Spark job.

``Runtime code``
  The code that does the actual job and usually runs in the cluster. For 
  example, Spark code that transforms raw data into preprocessed data.

Note the naming convention for client code and runtime code&mdash;for a task 
named "mytask":

* The `mytask.py` program contains the client code.
* The `mytask` directory contains all the runtime code.

A component consists of an interface (inputs/outputs), the implementation 
(a Docker container image and command-line arguments) and metadata 
(name, description).

Components can be instantiated inside the `pipeline` function to create tasks.

There are multiple ways to author components:

* Wrap an existing Docker container image using `ContainerOp`, as described 
  below.
* Create a 
  [lightweight python component](/docs/guides/pipelines/lightweight-python-components) 
  from a Python function
* Build a new Docker container image from a Python function.

## Example: XGBoost DataProc components

* [Set up cluster](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/components/dataproc/xgboost/create_cluster.py)
* [Analyze](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/components/dataproc/xgboost/analyze.py)
* [Transform](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/components/dataproc/xgboost/transform.py)
* [Train (distributed)](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/components/dataproc/xgboost/train.py)
* [Delete cluster](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/components/dataproc/xgboost/delete_cluster.py)

## Requirements for building a component

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker).

## Step One: Create a container for each component

In most cases, you need to create your own container image that includes your 
program. See the  
[container building examples](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/components). 
(In the directory, go to any subdirectory and then go to the `containers` directory.)

If your component creates some outputs to be fed as inputs to the downstream 
components, each output must be a string and must be written to a separate local 
text file by the container image. For example, if a trainer component needs to 
output the trained model path, it writes the path into a  local file 
`/output.txt`. In the Python class (in step three), you have the chance to 
specify how to map the content  of local files to component outputs.

<!---[TODO]: Add how to produce UI metadata.--->

## Step Two: Create a Python class for your component

The Python classes describe the interactions with the Docker container image 
created in step one. For example, a component to create confusion matrix data 
from prediction results looks like this:

```python
class ConfusionMatrixOp(kfp.dsl.ContainerOp):

  def __init__(self, name, predictions, output_path):
    super(ConfusionMatrixOp, self).__init__(
      name=name,
      image='gcr.io/project-id/ml-pipeline-local-confusion-matrix:v1',
      command=['python', '/ml/confusion_matrix.py'],
      arguments=[
        '--output', '%s/{{workflow.name}}/confusionmatrix' % output_path,
        '--predictions', predictions
     ],
     file_outputs={'label': '/output.txt'})

```

Note:

* Each component needs to inherit from `kfp.dsl.ContainerOp`.
* If you already defined ENTRYPOINT in the container image, you don’t need to 
  provide `command` unless you want to override it.
* In the init arguments, there can be Python native types (such as str, int) and 
  `kfp.dsl.PipelineParam` types. Each `kfp.dsl.PipelineParam` represents a 
  parameter whose value is usually only known at run time. It might be a 
  pipeline  parameter whose value is provided at pipeline run time by user, or 
  it can be an output from an upstream component. 
  In the above case, `predictions` and `output_path` are `kfp.dsl.PipelineParam` types.
* Although the value of each PipelineParam is only available at run time, you 
  can still use the parameters inline in the  argument (note the “%s”). This 
  means at run time the argument contains the value of the param inline.
* `file_outputs` lists a map between labels and local file paths. In the above 
  case, the content of `/output.txt` is gathered as a string output of the 
  operator. To reference the output in code:

    ```python
    op = ConfusionMatrixOp(...)
    op.outputs['label']
    ```

If there is only one output then you can also do `op.output`.

## Step Three: Create your workflow as a Python function

Each pipeline is identified as a Python function. For example:

```python
@kfp.dsl.pipeline(
  name='TFX Trainer',
  description='A trainer that does end-to-end training for TFX models.'
)
def train(
    output_path,
    train_data=kfp.dsl.PipelineParam('train-data',
        value='gs://ml-pipeline-playground/tfx/taxi-cab-classification/train.csv'),
    eval_data=kfp.dsl.PipelineParam('eval-data',
        value='gs://ml-pipeline-playground/tfx/taxi-cab-classification/eval.csv'),
    schema=kfp.dsl.PipelineParam('schema',
        value='gs://ml-pipeline-playground/tfx/taxi-cab-classification/schema.json'),
    target=kfp.dsl.PipelineParam('target', value='tips'),
    learning_rate=kfp.dsl.PipelineParam('learning-rate', value=0.1),
    hidden_layer_size=kfp.dsl.PipelineParam('hidden-layer-size', value='100,50'),
    steps=kfp.dsl.PipelineParam('steps', value=1000),
    slice_columns=kfp.dsl.PipelineParam('slice-columns', value='trip_start_hour'),
    true_class=kfp.dsl.PipelineParam('true-class', value='true'),
    need_analysis=kfp.dsl.PipelineParam('need-analysis', value='true'),
)
```

Note:

* **@kfp.dsl.pipeline** is a required decoration including `name` and 
  `description` properties.
* Input arguments show up as pipeline parameters in the Kubeflow Pipelines UI. 
  As a Python rule, positional  args go first and keyword args go next.
* Each function argument is of type `kfp.dsl.PipelineParam`. The default values 
  should all be of that type. The default values show up in the Kubeflow 
  Pipelines UI but can be overwritten.
