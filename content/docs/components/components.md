Kubeflow offers scripts and configuration files to activate a number of
supported components. To use Kubeflow, you choose the services that you want
to use for each stage of the ML workflow (data preparation, model training,
serving predictions, service management).

The *components* section of the documentation describes the supported
components and their configuration. See the left-hand navigation panel for
a list of components.
