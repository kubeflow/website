Your Kubeflow deployment includes Central Dashboard as a key component to provide quick access to all components deployed in your cluster. Some features include:
- Quick action, pipelines cards, metrics, and high level kubernetes events for an overview of your jobs and cluster in one view
- Housing view for all sub services running inside the cluster: `Pipelines`, `Katib`, `Notebooks`, etc.
- Helps users ramp up their environment with a [registration flow](/docs/central-dash/registration-flow/) (for multi-user isolation, or the first namespace for a shared deployment)
- Allows you to [manage your own namespaces (workgroups)](/docs/other-guides/multi-user-overview.md).
