## In-cluster authentication

When you [set up Kubeflow for GCP](/docs/gke/deploy), it will automatically 
[provision three service accounts](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/gke/deploy/deploy-cli/#gcp-service-accounts) with different
privileges. In particular, the `${KFAPP}-user` service account is meant to grant your user services access to GCP. 
The credentials to this service account can be accessed within the cluster as a
[Kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

The secret will have basic access to a limited set of GCP services by default, but more roles can be granted through the
[GCP IAM console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/).

### Authentication from a Pod

You must do two things to access a GCP service account from a Pod:

1. **Mount the secret as a file.** This will give your Pod access to your GCP account, 
so be careful which Pods you grant access to.
1. **Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable** to point to the service account.
GCP libraries will use this environment variable to find the service account and authenticate with GCP.

The following YAML describes a Pod that has access to the `${KFAPP}-user` service account:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: myimage
    env:
    - name: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
      value: "/var/secrets/user-sa.json"
    volumeMounts:
    - name: gcp-secret
      mountPath: "/var/secrets/user-sa.json"
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: gcp-secret
    secret:
      secretName: myappname-user
```

### Authentication from Kubeflow Pipelines
In [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/), each step describes a 
container that is run independently. If you want to grant access for a single step to use
 one of your service accounts, you can use 
[`kfp.gcp.use_gcp_secret()`](https://kubeflow-pipelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/kfp.extensions.html#kfp.gcp.use_gcp_secret).
Examples for how to use this function can be found in the 
[Kubeflow examples repo](https://github.com/kubeflow/examples/blob/871895c54402f68685c8e227c954d86a81c0575f/pipelines/mnist-pipelines/mnist_pipeline.py#L97).

## Local Authentication

### gcloud


[The `gcloud` tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) is used to interact with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) over the command line. 
You can use the `gcloud` command to [set up Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/create), 
and interact with other Google services.

##### Logging in

You have two options for authenticating the `gcloud` command:

- You can use a **user account** to authenticate using a Google account (typically Gmail). 
You can register a user account using [`gcloud auth login`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login), 
which brings up a browser window to start the familiar Google authentication flow.

- You can create a **service account** within your GCP project. You can then
[download a `.json` key file](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) 
associated with the account, and run the 
[`gcloud auth activate-service-account`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/activate-service-account)
command to authenticate your `gcloud` session.

You can find more information in the [GCP docs](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing).

##### Listing active accounts

You can run the following command to verify you are authenticating with the expected account. 
In the output of the command, an asterisk denotes your active account.

```
gcloud auth list
```

##### Viewing IAM roles

Permissions are handled in GCP using [IAM Roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles). 
These roles define which resources your account can read or write to. Provided you have the 
[necessary permissions](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles#required_permissions_and_roles_),
you can check which roles were assigned to your account using the following gcloud command:

```
PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id-here

gcloud projects get-iam-policy $PROJECT_ID --flatten="bindings[].members" \
    --format='table(bindings.role)' \
    --filter="bindings.members:$(gcloud config list account --format 'value(core.account)')"
```

You can view and modify roles through the 
[GCP IAM console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/).


You can find more information about IAM in the 
[GCP docs](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access).

### kubectl
The [`kubectl` tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) is used for interacting with a Kubernetes cluster through the command line.

##### Connecting to a cluster using a GCP account
If you set up your Kubernetes cluster using GKE, you can authenticate with the cluster using a GCP account. 
The following commands fetch the credentials for your cluster and save them to your local 
[`kubeconfig` file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/):

```
CLUSTER_NAME=your-gke-cluster
ZONE=your-gcp-zone

gcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER_NAME --zone $ZONE
```

You can find more information in the 
[GCP docs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl).

##### Changing active clusters
If you work with multiple Kubernetes clusters, you may have multiple contexts saved in your local 
[`kubeconfig` file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/).
You can view the clusters you have saved by run the following command:

```
kubectl config get-contexts
```

You can view which cluster is currently being controlled by `kubectl` with the following command:
```
CONTEXT_NAME=your-new-context

kubectl config set-context $CONTEXT_NAME
```

You can find more information in the 
[Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/).

##### Checking RBAC permissions

Like GKE IAM, Kubernetes permissions are typically handled with a "role-based authorization control" (RBAC) system.
Each Kubernetes service account has a set of authorized roles associated with it. If your account doesn't have the 
right roles assigned to it, certain tasks will fail.

You can check if an account has the proper permissions to run a command by building a query structured as
`kubectl auth can-i [VERB] [RESOURCE] --namespace [NAMESPACE]`. For example, the following command will verify
that your account has permissions to create deployments in the `kubeflow` namespace:

```
kubectl auth can-i create deployments --namespace kubeflow
```

You can find more information in the 
[Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/).

##### Adding RBAC permissions
If you find you are missing a permission you need, you can grant the missing roles to your service account using
Kubernetes resources.

- **Roles** describe the permissions you want to assign. For example, `verbs: ["create"], resources:["deployments"]`
- **RoleBindings** define a mapping between the `Role`, and a specific service account

By default, `Roles` and `RoleBindings` apply only to resources in a specific namespace, but there are also
`ClusterRoles` and `ClusterRoleBindings` that can grant access to resources cluster-wide

You can find more information in the 
[Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#role-and-clusterrole).
