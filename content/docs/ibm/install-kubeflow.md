This guide describes how to use the kfctl binary to
deploy Kubeflow on IBM Cloud.

## Prerequisites

### Installing the IBM Cloud developer tools

> If you already have `ibmcloud` installed with the `ibmcloud cs` plugin, you
> can skip these steps.

1.  Download and install the `ibmcloud` command line tool:
    https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/index.html#overview

1.  Install the `cs` (container-service) plugin:
    ```
    ibmcloud plugin install container-service -r Bluemix
    ```
1.  Authorize `ibmcloud`:
    ```
    ibmcloud login
    ```

### Setting environment variables

To simplify the command lines for this walkthrough, you need to define a few
environment variables.

1.  Set `CLUSTER_NAME`, `CLUSTER_REGION`, and `CLUSTER_ZONE` variables:

    ```
    export CLUSTER_NAME=knative
    export CLUSTER_REGION=us-south
    export CLUSTER_ZONE=dal13
    ```

    - `CLUSTER_NAME` must be lowercase and unique among any other Kubernetes
      clusters in this IBM Cloud region.
    - `CLUSTER_REGION` can be any region where IKS is available. You can get a
      list of all available regions via the
      [IBM Cloud documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_regions.html#regions-and-zones)
      or via `ibmcloud cs regions`.
    - `CLUSTER_ZONE` can be any zone that is available in the specified region
      above. You can get a list of all avaible locations from the
      [IBM Cloud documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_regions.html#zones)
      or by using `ibmcloud cs zones` after you set the region by using
      `ibmcloud cs region-set $CLUSTER_REGION`.

### Creating a IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster

To make sure the cluster is large enough to host all the Knative and Istio
components, the recommended configuration for a cluster is:

- Kubernetes version 1.15 or later
- 4 vCPU nodes with 16GB memory (`b2c.4x16`)

1.  Set `ibmcloud` to the appropriate region:

    ```
    ibmcloud cs region-set $CLUSTER_REGION
    ```

1.  Create a Kubernetes cluster on IKS with the required specifications:

    ```
    ibmcloud cs cluster-create --name=$CLUSTER_NAME \
      --zone=$CLUSTER_ZONE \
      --machine-type=b2c.4x16 \
      --workers=3
    ```

    If you're starting in a fresh account with no public and private VLANs, they
    are created automatically for you. If you already have VLANs configured in
    your account, get them via `ibmcloud cs vlans --zone $CLUSTER_ZONE` and
    include the public/private VLAN in the `cluster-create` command:

    ```
    ibmcloud cs cluster-create --name=$CLUSTER_NAME \
      --zone=$CLUSTER_ZONE \
      --machine-type=b2c.4x16 \
      --workers=3 \
      --private-vlan $PRIVATE_VLAN_ID \
      --public-vlan $PUBLIC_VLAN_ID
    ```

1.  Wait until your Kubernetes cluster is deployed:

    ```
    ibmcloud cs clusters | grep $CLUSTER_NAME
    ```

    It can take a while for your cluster to be deployed. Repeat the above
    command until the state of your cluster is "normal".


1.  Point `kubectl` to the cluster:

    ```
    ibmcloud cs cluster-config $CLUSTER_NAME
    ```

    Follow the instructions on the screen to `EXPORT` the correct `KUBECONFIG`
    value to point to the created cluster.


1.  Make sure all nodes are up:

    ```
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    Make sure all the nodes are in `Ready` state. You are now ready to install
    Istio into your cluster.

## Understanding the Kubeflow deployment process

The deployment process is controlled by the following commands:

* **build** - (Optional) Creates configuration files defining the various
  resources in your deployment. You only need to run `kfctl build` if you want
  to edit the resources before running `kfctl apply`.
* **apply** - Creates or updates the resources.
* **delete** - Deletes the resources.

### App layout

Your Kubeflow application directory **${KF_DIR}** contains the following files and 
directories:

* **${CONFIG_FILE}** is a YAML file that defines configurations related to your 
  Kubeflow deployment.

  * This file is a copy of the GitHub-based configuration YAML file that
    you used when deploying Kubeflow. For example, {{% config-uri-k8s-istio %}}.
  * When you run `kfctl apply` or `kfctl build`, kfctl creates
    a local version of the configuration file, `${CONFIG_FILE}`,
    which you can further customize if necessary.

* **kustomize** is a directory that contains the kustomize packages for Kubeflow applications.
    * The directory is created when you run `kfctl build` or `kfctl apply`.
    * You can customize the Kubernetes resources (modify the manifests and run `kfctl apply` again).


## Kubeflow installation
Run the following commands to set up and deploy Kubeflow.

1. Download the kfctl {{% kf-latest-version %}} release from the
  [Kubeflow releases 
  page](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/releases/tag/{{% kf-latest-version %}}).

1. Unpack the tar ball
      ```
      tar -xvf kfctl_{{% kf-latest-version %}}_<platform>.tar.gz
      ```

1. Run the following commands to set up and deploy Kubeflow. The code below includes an optional command to add the binary kfctl to your path. If you donâ€™t add the binary to your path, you must use the full path to the kfctl binary each time you run it.

    ```
    # The following command is optional, to make kfctl binary easier to use.
    export PATH=$PATH:<path to where kfctl was unpacked>

    # Set KF_NAME to the name of your Kubeflow deployment. This also becomes the
    # name of the directory containing your configuration.
    # For example, your deployment name can be 'my-kubeflow' or 'kf-test'.
    export KF_NAME=<your choice of name for the Kubeflow deployment>

    # Set the path to the base directory where you want to store one or more 
    # Kubeflow deployments. For example, /opt/.
    # Then set the Kubeflow application directory for this deployment.
    export BASE_DIR=<path to a base directory>
    export KF_DIR=${BASE_DIR}/${KF_NAME}

    # Set the configuration file to use, such as the file specified below:
    export CONFIG_URI="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/master/kfdef/kfctl_ibm.yaml"

    # Generate and deploy Kubeflow:
    mkdir -p ${KF_DIR}
    cd ${KF_DIR}
    kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG_URI}
    ```

    * **${KF_NAME}** - The name of your Kubeflow deployment.
      If you want a custom deployment name, specify that name here.
      For example,  `my-kubeflow` or `kf-test`.
      The value of KF_NAME must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or
      '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
      The value of this variable cannot be greater than 25 characters. It must
      contain just a name, not a directory path.
      This value also becomes the name of the directory where your Kubeflow 
      configurations are stored, that is, the Kubeflow application directory. 

    * **${KF_DIR}** - The full path to your Kubeflow application directory.

1. Check the resources deployed correctly in namespace `kubeflow`

     ```
     kubectl get all -n kubeflow
     ```

1. Open Kubeflow Dashboard. The default installation does not create an external endpoint but you can use port-forwarding to visit your cluster. Run the following command and visit http://localhost:8080.

     ```
     kubectl port-forward svc/istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system 8080:80
     ```

In case you want to expose the Kubeflow Dashboard over an external IP, you can change the type of the ingress gateway. To do that, you can edit the service:

     kubectl edit -n istio-system svc/istio-ingressgateway

From that file, replace `type: NodePort` with `type: LoadBalancer` and save.

While the change is being applied, you can watch the service until below command prints a value under the `EXTERNAL-IP` column:

     kubectl get -w -n istio-system svc/istio-ingressgateway

The external IP should be accessible by visiting http://<EXTERNAL-IP>. Note that above installation instructions do not create any protection for the external endpoint so it will be accessible to anyone without any authentication.
