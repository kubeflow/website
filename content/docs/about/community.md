In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body

experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

The Kubeflow community is guided by our [Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
which we encourage everybody to read before participating. We hold our leaders
accountable for the guidelines in
[this document](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/INCLUSIVITY.md).

## Community discussions

There are many ways to contribute! Join one of our communication channels, 
attend a community meeting, get to know the community, discuss updates, suggest
exciting new integrations.

### Community meetings

[**Meeting calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=kubeflow.org_7l5vnbn8suj2se10sen81d9428%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles) ([iCal version](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/kubeflow.org_7l5vnbn8suj2se10sen81d9428%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)).

[Meeting notes](http://bit.ly/kf-meeting-notes).

If your group has a regular meeting, talk to
[@ewilderj](https://github.com/ewilderj) about getting it added to the calendar.

### Kubeflow community call

The project team holds a weekly community call on Tuesdays. This call alternates
weekly between US East/EMEA and US West/APAC friendly times. Joining the
[kubeflow-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubeflow-discuss)
mailing list will automatically send you calendar invitations for the meetings, or you can subscribe to the community meeting calendar above.

Agenda, notes, and a reminder of the next call are sent to the kubeflow-discuss
mailing list.
