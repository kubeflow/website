### Does Kubeflow Support Helm?

Yes Kubeflow support Helm. You don't need to use ksonnet to use TFServing, TFJob and others. You can define those resources using whatever K8s tooling you want; raw YAML, Helm, Kustomize, Ksonnet.

We provide Kustomize mostly as convenient syntax sugar. The arena CLI might have Helm Charts (https://github.com/helm/charts) if that's the route you prefer.
