### Does Kubeflow Support Helm?

Yes kubeflow support helm. You don't need to use ksonnet to use TFServing, TFJob, etc... You can define those resources using whatever K8s tooling you want; raw YAML, helm, kustomize, ksonnet.

We provide ksonnet mostly as convenient syntax sugar. The arena CLI might have helm charts if that's the route you prefer.
