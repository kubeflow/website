* [Ksonnet](https://ksonnet.io/docs/tutorial)

## Requirements
 * ksonnet version [0.11.0](https://ksonnet.io/#get-started). See the [ksonnet component page](/docs/guides/components/ksonnet/) for an explanation of why we use ksonnet.
 * An existing Kubernetes cluster >= 1.8:
   * A minimum of 0.6 CPU in cluster (Reserved for 3 replicated ambassador pods and according to your need add additional CPUs)
