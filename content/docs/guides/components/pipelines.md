Kubeflow Pipelines is a platform for building and deploying portable and
scalable end-to-end ML workflows, based on containers.

The Kubeflow Pipelines platform has the following goals:

* End-to-end orchestration: enabling and simplifying the orchestration of
  machine learning pipelines.
* Easy experimentation: making it easy for you to try numerous ideas and 
  techniques and manage your various trials/experiments.
* Easy re-use: enabling you to re-use components and pipelines to quickly 
  cobble together end-to-end solutions, without having to rebuild each time.
