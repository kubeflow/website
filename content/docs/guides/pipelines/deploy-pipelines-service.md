Starting from 
[v0.1.3](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/releases/tag/0.1.3), 
Kubeflow Pipelines becomes one of the Kubeflow core components. It's 
automatically deployed during Kubeflow deployment. 

Note: Due to 
[kubeflow/pipelines#345](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/issues/345) and 
[kubeflow/pipelines#337](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/issues/337), 
Kubeflow Pipelines depends on GCP services and some of the functionality is not 
supported by non-GKE clusters.
You can try Kubeflow Pipelines currently with a Kubeflow deployment on GKE. 
See the [GKE setup guide](/docs/started/getting-started-gke/).
