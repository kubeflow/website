**Download a kfctl release from the 
[Kubeflow releases page](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/releases/).**

Notes:

* kfctl is the executable binary file that you use to deploy Kubeflow.
* The kfctl binary currently supports only Kubeflow deployments on
  Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The goal is to support other platforms too.
  **Contributions welcome.** See issue 
  [kubeflow/#2954](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/2954).

## Next steps

Follow the guide to [deploying Kubeflow on GCP](/docs/gke/deploy/deploy-cli/).
