### 404 Command Not Found when downloading scripts
```shell
➜ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/$\{KUBEFLOW_TAG\}/scripts/download.sh | bash
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

bash: line 1: 404:: command not found
```

Please remove the escape backslashes surrounding `{KUBEFLOW_TAG}`.


### Environment File Not Found

```shell
+ source env.sh
/tmp/kubeflow-aws/scripts/kfctl.sh: line 485: env.sh: No such file or directory
```

When you run generate/apply platform/k8s, Please make sure you verify the following steps and run your command from within the ${KFAPP} folder.


### kfapp already exists

```shell
+ echo 'Directory kfapp already exists'
Directory kfapp already exists
+ exit 1
```

This happens if you have invalid arguments when you initialize your configuration and you try to rerun command with correct arguments. The `kfapp` folder already exists. Delete `kfapp` and try again.


### EKS Cluster Creation Failure

There are several problems that could lead to cluster creation failure. If you see some errors when creating your cluster using `eksctl`, please open the CloudFormation console and check your stacks. To recover from failure, you need to follow the guidance from the `eksctl` output logs. Once you understand the root cause of your failure, you can delete your cluster and rerun `${KUBEFLOW_SRC}/scripts/kfctl.sh apply platform`.

Common issues:

1. The default VPC limit is 5 VPCs per region
1. Invalid command arguments

```shell
+ eksctl create cluster --config-file=/tmp/cluster_config.yaml
[ℹ]  using region us-west-2
[ℹ]  subnets for us-west-2b - public:192.168.0.0/19 private:192.168.96.0/19

### Resource Not Found in `delete all`

```shell
+ kubectl get ns/kubeflow
Error from server (NotFound): namespaces "kubeflow" not found
+ kubectl get ns/kubeflow
Error from server (NotFound): namespaces "kubeflow" not found
+ echo 'namespace kubeflow successfully deleted.'
```

You can ignore any Kubernetes "resource not found" errors that occur during the deletion phase.


### InvalidParameterException in UpdateCluster

```shell
+ logging_components='"api","audit","authenticator","controllerManager","scheduler"'
++ aws eks update-cluster-config --name benchmark-0402222-sunday-satur --region us-west-2 --logging '{"clusterLogging":[{"types":["api","audit","authenticator","controllerManager","scheduler"],"enabled":true}]}'

An error occurred (InvalidParameterException) when calling the UpdateClusterConfig operation: No changes needed for the logging config provided
```

The Amazon EKS `UpdateCluster` API operation will fail if you have invalid parameters. For example, if you already enabled logs in your EKS cluster, and you choose to create Kubeflow on existing cluster and also enable logs, you will get this error.

### FSX Mount Failure

```shell
Mounting command: mount
Mounting arguments: -t lustre fs-0xxxxx2a216cf.us-west-2.amazonaws.com@tcp:/fsx /var/lib/kubelet/pods/224c2c96-5a91-11e9-b7e6-0a2a42c99f84/volumes/kubernetes.io~csi/fsx-static/mount
Output: mount.lustre: Can't parse NID 'fs-0xxxxx2a216cf.us-west-2.amazonaws.com@tcp:/fsx'

This mount helper should only be invoked via the mount (8) command,
e.g. mount -t lustre dev dir

usage: mount.lustre [-fhnvV] [-o <mntopt>] <device> <mountpt>
  <device>: the disk device, or for a client:
    <mgsnid>[:<altmgsnid>...]:/<filesystem>[/<subdir>]
  <filesystem>: name of the Lustre filesystem (e.g. lustre1)
  <mountpt>: filesystem mountpoint (e.g. /mnt/lustre)
  -f|--fake: fake mount (updates /etc/mtab)
```

The Amazon FSx `dnsName` is incorrect, you can delete your pod using this persistent volume claim. The next step is to delete the PV and PVC. Next correct your input and reapply the PV and PVC.

```shell
kubectl delete pod ${pod_using_pvc}
ks delete default -c ${COMPONENT}
ks param set ${COMPONENT} dnsName fs-0xxxxx2a216cf.fsx.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
ks apply default -c ${COMPONENT}
```

### Incompatible eksctl version

If you see this error when you run `apply platform`, it means your eksctl cli version is not compatible with `eksctl.io` version in cluster_config.yaml. Please upgrade your eksctl and try again.
`v1alpha5` is introduced from 0.1.31.

We are working with eksctl team to make sure feature release support backward compatibility at least for one version.

```
loading config file "${KUBEFLOW_SRC}/${KFAPP}/aws_config/cluster_config.yaml": no kind "ClusterConfig" is registered for version "eksctl.io/v1alpha5" in scheme "k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes/scheme/register.go:60"
