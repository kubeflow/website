## Help
There are several places to get help with KFP:

* [kubeflow-pipelines][kfp-stack-overflow] on Stack Overflow
* The #kubeflow-pipelines channel in the [Kubeflow Slack Workspace](https://kubeflow.slack.com/)
* Via a GitHub Issue describing your problem in the [kubeflow/pipelines repository][create-github-issue]
* In the Kubeflow Pipelines Community Meeting
## Kubeflow Pipelines Community Meeting
There is a Kubeflow Pipelines Community meeting every other Wednesday. This is an opportunity to learn about changes to KFP developments, discuss feature requests, and ask questions. When making a feature request, it is best to include a [GitHub Issue][create-github-issue] as a written accompaniment to your request.

To participate, join [kubeflow-discuss][kubeflow-discuss-google-group] on Google Groups.

## Bugs and Feature Requests
Bugs and feature requests should be recorded as GitHub Issues in the [kubeflow/pipelines repository][create-github-issue].
