<p><i>Due to
<a href="https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/issues/1700">kubeflow/pipelines#1700</a>,
the container builder in Kubeflow Pipelines currently supports only
Google Container Registry. This means that you can only store the containers
containing your pipeline code on Container Registry.</i>
